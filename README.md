# PyCon AU 2023 website

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

Yes, we're fully aware of the irony of building the website for a Python conference with JavaScript tooling ;) Previous versions of this site were built with [Statik](https://getstatik.com), and Astro is very similar in spirit while being more actively maintained.

## Installing and running

You'll need to install Node.js (which you can usually get from your friendly local system package manager) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation). Then, run:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
