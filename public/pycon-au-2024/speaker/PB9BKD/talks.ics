DESCRIPTION:Software builders and operators have long looked to transport a
 nd aviation for lessons in engineering practices and safety. Today\, we’
 ll turn our attention to the railways as we take 20 years of hindsight to 
 look at the ‘Broady runaway’ and what it can teach us. This talk will 
 dive into the ATSB’s subsequent safety investigation\, recommendations a
 nd parallels in the software world\, offering us critical lessons in compl
 ex system design and incident management.\n\nFor software engineers\, arch
 itects\, managers and executives this is an opportunity for us to reflect 
 and learn from the past so that we can build more resilient and easier to 
 operate platforms in the future.\n\nOur runaway train is a 3 car electrica
 l multiple unit (EMU) that\, in 2003\, did the full 17km Broadmeadows to S
 pencer st run in just 16 minutes\, famously without a driver on board. The
  cause of the runaway and resulting collision with a stationary diesel loc
 omotive has been the talk of many rail enthusiasts ever since\, especially
  since there were no fatalities or serious injuries.
