DESCRIPTION:Beginner programmers often struggle to understand and trace pro
 gram execution\, which is worsened by underdeveloped debugging and testing
  skills. Beginners may also lack confidence or are easily demotivated\, wh
 ich can hinder learning. To assist students in developing these skills and
  build confidence we created a set of playful programming challenges and c
 ompetition using Karel the Robot. The Karel system provides a 2D “grid w
 orld” where the Karel character can move and interact with its environme
 nt. The 2D world is visualised for students so that they can immediately s
 ee how their program changes the environment step by step as well as the f
 inal program state. This is in contrast to traditional languages where lea
 rners must develop and maintain a mental model of the program state. This 
 talk will cover our approach\, preliminary results and feedback from stude
 nts showing an increase in confidence and interest in programming. We will
  also share how this approach can be applied to other learning contexts.
