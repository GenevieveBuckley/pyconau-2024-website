CipherStash helps Python devs encrypt sensitive data, without sacrificing performance or usability. With CipherStash you can index and search encrypted data in PostgreSQL with SQL. 

CipherStash Proxy is a transparent proxy that sits between your Python application and your PostgreSQL database and handles the encryption and decryption of data.

CipherStash for DynamoDB provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving encrypted data in DynamoDB.

Encryption in use keeps data encrypted even while it's queried in the database, plus itâ€™s blazing fast and easy to use.
