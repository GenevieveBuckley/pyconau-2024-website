The Django Software Foundation is a US-based non-profit organisation with the mission to promote, support, and advance the Django Web framework - the Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your apps without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source, and used by startups and Fortune 500 companies - companies like Instagram, Pinterest, NASA, and the US Library of Congress.
