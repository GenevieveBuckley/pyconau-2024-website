bio: "<p>Ash is a cyber security engineer with a background in medical device testing.
  Chronically incapable of saying no to interesting projects or weird technical problems,
  they are also allergic to writing scripts more than ~300 lines long. Involved in
  a number of pride networks, they're passionate about expanding queer representation
  in cyber security and engineering. </p>\n<p>They still haven't figured out what
  DevSecOps is, and at this point are too afraid to ask.</p>"
