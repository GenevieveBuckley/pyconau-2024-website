bio: <p>Throughout my tenure as a software engineer, technical lead, and engineering
  manager, I have navigated through public and private sectors, and fast-paced startups.
  Along this journey, I have delved into a broad spectrum of technologies from mobile
  and web, to data pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and automations. As a developer
  advocate at MongoDB, I would like to help fellow engineers make better design decisions
  with not just theoretical knowledge, but also a pragmatic mindset. On any typical
  day, you might catch me lost in thoughts with a cup of coffee in my hands.</p>
