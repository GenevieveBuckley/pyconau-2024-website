bio: "<p>Iâ€™m Eliz So, a student from Australian National University (ANU) studying
  a double degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics and Science (majoring in Computer
  Science and minoring in Mathematics). I have been fascinated by how computing works
  since young, and decided to learn programming then! </p>\n<p>In my free time I enjoy
  creating 3D models, photography and videography, playing music and bouldering. Iâ€™m
  looking forward to putting my computing skills in my hobbies as well, such as integrating
  computer vision with photography and videography. In the meantime, I would love
  to learn more about different aspects in machine learning and theoretical computing.
  </p>\n<p>Hi, I am Anneysha, I am studying Advanced Computing at the Australian National
  University. I love languages, and learning as many language scripts as I can!</p>\n
  <p>I am interested in solving problems using a human-centric approach with strong
  backing from existing data and applying computational techniques to it, such as
  Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. In my free time, I like watching
  anime, cooking (things Iâ€™ve never made before!), and travelling.</p>\n<p>Fun fact:
  Eliz and I met in our first semester at university when we were doing the same Finance
  and Computing courses. ðŸ™‚</p>"
