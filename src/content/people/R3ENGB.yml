bio: "<p>Hi, I am Anneysha, I am studying Advanced Computing at the Australian National
  University. I love languages, and learning as many language scripts as I can!</p>\n
  <p>I am interested in solving problems using a human-centric approach with strong
  backing from existing data and applying computational techniques to it, such as
  Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. In my free time, I like watching
  anime, cooking (things Iâ€™ve never made before!), and travelling.</p>"
