bio: "<p>I’m Eliz, a student from Australian National University (ANU) studying a
  double degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics and Science (majoring in Computer
  Science and minoring in Mathematics). I have been fascinated by how computing works
  since young, and decided to learn programming then! \nIn my free time I enjoy creating
  3D models, photography and videography, playing music and bouldering. I’m looking
  forward to putting my computing skills in my hobbies as well, such as integrating
  computer vision with photography and videography. In the meantime, I would love
  to learn more about different aspects in machine learning and theoretical computing.</p>"
