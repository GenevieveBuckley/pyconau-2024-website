  Yes, sigh, he's getting old.</p>\n<p>Having worked on a wide variety of projects
  - from tiny embedded applications to large web-based system - means that he has

  technical pursuits he also loves rock climbing and, generally, being in the outdoors.</p>\n
  <p>Matt hosts the Melbourne MicroPython Meetup; and hopes to see you there when
