bio: <p>Long is a junior data scientist at WSP, who likes all things math, deep learning,
  and computer science. I am most at home crunching through some algorithm/coding
  problems with too much scratch paper and a pen. When I am not at work, you can find
  me watching anime, playing gacha games, going on random walks if the weather is
  nice, meeting friends and new people, or trying to get a neural network's loss to
  go down.</p>
