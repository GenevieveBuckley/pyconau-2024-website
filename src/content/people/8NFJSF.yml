bio: <p>I'm a research scientist helping other scientists get insights from their
  image data using Python. I've been using Python since 2008, and the main scientific
  Python ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, &amp; co) since 2010. In 2012, on a whim, I went
  to my first SciPy (US) conference, and it changed my life! I realised that "open
  source" didn't mean just posting the code online. It meant actively collaborating
  on code with other scientists, across vast distances and at different times. Before
  you could say "import numpy as np", I had joined the scikit-image team, written
  a paper about it, written a whole book on SciPy (!), spoken at various SciPys and
  PyConAUs, started new collaborative, open source libraries, and just generally been
  all-in on Scientific Python. I love this community and what it has done for me,
  and always try to pay it forward for new folks in our community! ðŸ˜Š</p>
