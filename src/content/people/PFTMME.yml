  artificial intelligence and extended reality technologies. Their work explores posthuman
  and postgender concepts using classical art combined with new media techniques and
  programming.</p>\n<p>J received their PhD at RMIT University in 2023 exploring AI
  Perceptions of Gender and the nature of AI generated art and the human hands behind
  the processes that engender bias, especially towards gender minorities. Their artwork
  highlights this bias through programmatic interactive artworks and traditional gallery
  displays. They speak at conferences worldwide about the use of artificial intelligence
  in art and have exhibited all over the world. Jâ€™s artwork has been supported by
  the City of Melbourne Covid-19 Arts Grants and has won the Midsumma Australia Post

  technologies to create a speculative future grounded in the aesthetics of the past
  to show that gender minorities have always been here and will continue into the
  future.</p>"
