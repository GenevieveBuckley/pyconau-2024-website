bio: <p>I'm currently a PhD student working on timelapse microscopy data analysis,
  and I've been learning and working with Python for almost a decade now! I love the
  open-source community and everything it has to offer the world, and I've been lucky
  enough to make my own contributions to the community as a core developer for napari
  - an n-dimensional image viewer written entirely in Python. I'm passionate about
  making coding more accessible for scientists who want to make their own lives easier,
  and I love teaching everything from the fundamentals to the nitty gritty.</p>
