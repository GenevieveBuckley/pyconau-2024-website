bio: <p>Hello, I’m Artem, a Director of Software Engineering at Cover Genius, a global
  insurtech company. With around 15 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I
  currently specialise in Python API development using Django. I’m passionate about
  working with both people and systems, and I strive to close gaps between the two
  in a sustainable and responsible manner. Outside of work, I practice martial arts,
  currently focusing on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). I'm also organising SyDjango, a
  Django meetup group in Sydney.</p>
