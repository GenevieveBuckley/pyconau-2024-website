bio: "<p>Edwina Mead BEng (Hons), MPH, MGH\nPhD student, UTS\nResearch Assistant,
  UNSW</p>\n<p>Edwina is a PhD student in Public Health at the University of Technology
  Sydney, where she is combining her software engineering background with cutting-edge
  health research. She is harnessing Python's powerful data processing capabilities
  to automate a complex systematic review, synthesising vast amounts of medical literature
  to create a more holistic understanding of the far-reaching impacts of current maternity
  practices on women, children, health systems, and even the environment.</p>\n<p>In
  her role as a research assistant at UNSW, Edwina applies Python to rapidly analyse
  administrative data on ambulance attendances for drowning in NSW. This work has
  expanded our understanding of the drowning burden in the state, showcasing Python's
  versatility in public health research.</p>\n<p>Edwina's innovative approaches demonstrate
  how Python can accelerate and enhance research in public health, from streamlining
  data analysis to increasing the scope and depth of evidence synthesis.</p>\n<p>When
  she's not immersed in code or health data, Edwina can be found wrangling her two
  young children and playfully introducing them to computational thinking concepts
  - perhaps nurturing the next generation of Python enthusiasts!</p>"
