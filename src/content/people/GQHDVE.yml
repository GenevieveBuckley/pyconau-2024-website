bio: <p>Benno has been in the technology space since 1995, which is closer to the
  Apollo 11 moon landing than to today. He started out in system administration and
  technical support, moved into software development, dabbled in management, and then
  sidled back to development again. He's worked on everything from web applications
  to kernel code and, in a stunning turn of events, has opinions on all of it. He's
  also been involved in various community things including a stint as a member of
  the FreeBSD Core Team. He is not, as some claim, an expert on systemd, nor is he
  (unfortunately?) a bear in a hat.</p>
