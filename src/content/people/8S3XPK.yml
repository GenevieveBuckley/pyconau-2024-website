bio: "<p>Peter has been with AEMO, the Australia Energy Market Operator since soon
  after market start. The Australian electricity grid has undergone two major transformations:
  First in the late 1990s when the national market was created, and the states were
  interconnected. Now the biggest transformation is now underway as we move towards
  a 100% renewable grid. </p>\n<p>There are many software systems that support the
  electricity grid and market: Pascal, Fortran, C, Oracle and Java in the early days.
  Python, JavaScript &amp; Vue, C# &amp; C++ today.</p>\n<p>Peter’s team supports
  a suite of tools called AMP – The AEMO Modelling Platform – a ‘digital twins’ of
  the grid used to predict its behavior, design it into the future, and analyze operation
  faults. </p>\n<p>AMP Features a SQL Server &amp; Python backend running on Windows,
  with Vue &amp; JavaScript user interface. At the time of writing, we have 25,000
  lines of Python code, all linted and unit tested with 100% coverage.</p>\n<p>Some
  of the Pascal code we wrote in the late 90s is still in production delivering value
  to the industry. We are planning a 20 year or longer life for our Python code so
  have a somewhat manic focus on quality.</p>"
