  products . Over the years, I've had the opportunity to   lead teams in building\
  \  data and ML platforms, products, and work on organisational transformations \
  \ including evolving  data function operating models to scale. Iâ€™ve dabbled in various
  industries, including energy, accounting, airlines, retail and many more , helping
