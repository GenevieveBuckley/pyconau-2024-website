bio: "<p>👨‍🔧 Boundary spanner between Business and IT concerns. I've lived: Product
  Management, Consultancy, Iteration Management, Business Analysis, Data Analysis,
  Software Developer, Quality Assurance, to where it started as IT Support. Everyday
  I practise a bit of all this to deliver pragmatic and maintainable solutions.</p>\n
  <p>📊 I love the decision journey both as a contributor and a coordinator: from the
  wrangling, modeling, sampling, digging for insights, and the all important communication
  of insights and further actions.</p>\n<p>👨‍🏫 I get a kick out of teaching others
  to fish the many water bodies of data (be they ponds, lakes, or swamps).</p>"
