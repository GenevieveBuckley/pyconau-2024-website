bio: '<p>I am a curious individual who happens to be a programmer. My interest in
  computers actually started with microcontrollers and the digital design of processors,
  but once I figured dealing with hardware was expensive I decided to focus on software,
  only to find myself drawn back to it. I have done a lot of things throughout the
  years: wireless communication protocols, raytracing, games and game engines, art,
  cryptography, classical simulation of quantum processes and a lot more. At present
  I design and run experiments for validating Wi-Fi chips under real world conditions.</p>'
