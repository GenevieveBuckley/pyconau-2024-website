bio: <p>I love all things computing, from satellite communication systems to machine
  learning. I learned about Python around 2011, when trying to embed it in a Java
  game engine, and after having worked professionally in machine learning where Python
  is the default language, it never left my toolbox. Besides arguing with computers,
  I spend my time making music and digital art.</p>
