  shape analysis and phylogenetics to better understand these artefacts. In addition

  Data Analytics Platform (MDAP), exploring the application of deep learning techniques
  to the decipherment of ancient scripts, including the presently undeciphered Linear

  software tester and business analyst, and is passionate about combining both her
  digital and archaeological skills for improved research outcomes, as well as supporting
  and promoting the uptake of digital techniques in the humanities. Emily is a current
