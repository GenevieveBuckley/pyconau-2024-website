bio: "<p>As CTO of two small education related startups (ConnectEd Code and Kumo Study)
  and with plenty of varied consulting under my belt, I have a focus on how tech can
  help other fields progress. I love to learn what the problems are and how I can
  actually make an impact, ideally with as simple a program as possible.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve
  been using Python for years, working in both the professional and education sectors,
  and have focussed on bringing the power of Python to everyone.</p>"
