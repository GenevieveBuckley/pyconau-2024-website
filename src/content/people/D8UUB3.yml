bio: <p>I'm an experienced software engineer with 15+ years experience although only
  been working with Python mainly for around three years. I'm a generalist who likes
  to sample as much of the Python ecosystem as I can dabbling in both general software
  engineering and data science tech stacks. Coming from a games technology background
  the closest thing I'd have to a speciality is advanced and 3D data visualisation.
  I love being on the bleeding edge of technology and always keen to find and try
  applying new packages and share what I've found with anyone I can get to listen.</p>
