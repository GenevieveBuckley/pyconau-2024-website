bio: <p>Holding the host torch for the Melbourne based community of Djangonauts 'MelbDjango',
  Liz (she/her) hails from Common Code who are known for their elite bunch of Django
  software engineers. Liz comes from a slightly different background herself, working
  on national and international festivals and arts events, bringing large scale productions
  to life in operations, logistics and production. When Liz isn't with technologists
  or running events, she adventures somewhere off the beaten track, reads deep tech
  newsletters or gets outside in the garden (forever trying to get basil to not die).</p>
