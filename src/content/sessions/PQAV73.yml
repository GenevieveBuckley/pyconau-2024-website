abstract: "<p>In this workshop, we will build a ChatBot based on Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG). The ChatBot will leverage MongoDB Atlas, embedding models, Large
  Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextualized answers and textual content in
  accordance to usersâ€™ queries based on publicly available sources.</p>\n<p>In this
  hands-on workshop, attendees will:\n * Learn the foundations of Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG), such as chunking, embedding, and semantic search\n * Perform semantic
  search queries against a MongoDB Atlas collection \n * Build a simple RAG system
  using MongoDB Atlas and open-source LLMs</p>\n<p>Add memory to the RAG application\n
  * In addition to these goals, the lab also offers more advanced content that covers:\n
  * Combining pre-filtering with vector search\n * Adding re-ranking to the RAG application\n
  * Stream responses from the RAG application</p>\n<p>Attendees will be provided with
  all the resources required to successfully execute the hands-on portions of the
  workshop, including a GitHub repository consisting of notebook templates with pseudocode.
  Attendees will replace the pseudocode with their own code during the workshop.</p>"
