abstract: "<p>Let’s get this out of the way: This talk isn’t about convincing you
  to move to MongoDB. Migrating an existing app from an SQL database to MongoDB is
  not exactly easy!</p>\n<p>An application built on top of a typical relational database
  will have been built around the patterns and constraints of that way of thinking
  and MongoDB has a different way of thinking about data modelling. Translating the
  data model to work well with MongoDB requires an understanding of the context and
  usage patterns of the data.</p>\n<p>This presents a challenge for building migration
  tools. We want to make it as easy as possible for developers to migrate to MongoDB,
  but we also need to give developers control and flexibility to make decisions about
  how their data will be translated into a MongoDB schema. The result involves a surprising
  amount of thoughtful UX design for a database migration tool! This talk explores
  the steps and challenges of migrating relational data to MongoDB and the tools we’ve
  built to help give developers control over this process.</p>"
