description: "<p>As technology continues to advance, so does the way we process and
  store data. In recent years, Edge computing has emerged as an evolving technology
  that has the potential to transform the way we process and store data. But what
  exactly is Edge computing, and how does it differ from Cloud computing? Moreover,
  which approach is the right choice for your organization?</p>\n<p>In this talk,
  I will cover the following topics:\n-What is Edge computing? How it can address
  the limitations of traditional Cloud computing.\n-Edge computing Vs Cloud computing\n
  -Use cases for Edge computing \n-Making the right choice: Which approach makes the
  most sense based on your specific needs?</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk, attendees
  will gain insights into the current state and future of Edge computing, the benefits
  and challenges of Edge computing and how organizations can leverage this technology
  today or in the future.</p>"
