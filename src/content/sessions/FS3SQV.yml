title: N+1 Problem in Django Rest Framework
track: djangocon
abstract: <p>N+1 problems in Django are not new. Anyone who has worked with Django
  must have had some interaction with the N+1 problem. Django Rest Framework allows
  building robust APIs on top of Django. We will explore the N+1 problem in DRF, understand
  its occurrence in DRF views and serializer fields, and review its performance implications.</p>
description: "<p>Django and N+1 problems are a match made in heaven. N+1 is a common
  performance issue encountered in Django projects. Django Rest Framework builds on
  top of Django and allows the development of highly robust and dynamic APIs for Django
  apps. Using model serializers, creating a CRUD API with DRF has become simple. The
  simplicity comes with hidden costs and N+1 is among such costs.\nIn this talk, we
  will dive into the N+1 problem within the context of Django Rest Framework (DRF),
  and explore how it can appear on both Views and within the Serializers.</p>\n<p>Outline:\n
  - Speaker Introduction (2 mins)\n- N+1 problem introduction (5 mins)\n- N+1 on DRF
  views (7 mins)\n- N+1 on Serializer (8 mins)\n- Detecting &amp; Resolving N+1 problems
  (5 mins)\n- Closing thoughts (3 mins)</p>"
