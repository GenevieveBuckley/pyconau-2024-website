abstract: <p>Most Django sites contain information that effectively needs to be isolated
  from other users or groups. How can we use Django+Postgres to defend against developer
  mistakes to ensure private data doesn't leak to the wrong users?</p>
description: "<p>This talk discusses various strategies for ensuring that data in
  Django sites is correctly siloed and only visible to users who are intended to be
  able to access that data.</p>\n<p>Pros and cons of various database strategies and
  Django/Postgres extensions are discussed, including tenancy denormalisation, database-level
  enforcement, how to leverage custom Model Managers (and their limitations), incremental
  adoption, multiple databases/schemas/app servers and non-technical considerations.</p>"
