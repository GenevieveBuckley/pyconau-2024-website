title: Nothing for Us, Without Us; Breaking Unconscious Bias in Building Products
abstract: "<p>Are we really building products that serve everyone, or just a selected
  few?</p>\n<p>As developers, we have responsibility to ensure that our products serve
  everyone, regardless of their background or identity. However, our unconscious bias
  often creeps into even the most well-intentioned projects and impacts the way we
  develop products or engage with communities, leading to unintentional exclusions.</p>\n
  <p>When I first designed a Speech-Text-Analytic app, my focus was to simplify business
  communication with transcribed audio and valuable insights. However, feedback from
  the community highlighted it had limitations for diverse users, including those
  with disabilities who faced inaccurate captions for audio content.</p>\n<p>This
  wake-up call prompted me to improve accessibility and user-friendliness for marginalized
  groups. And for the same reason, I'm making proactive steps to cater for the marginalized
  by integrating a feature that recognizes Nigerian native languages.</p>\n<p>As tech
  creators, we have the power to create change, but good intentions alone are not
  enough. This talk will offer strategies to address unconscious bias in product and
  community building, while avoiding common pitfalls. Attendees will learn to understand
  diverse needs &amp; experiences for more inclusive environments.</p>"
description: "<p>In this talk, I'll share my experience developing a Speech-Text-Analytic
  app and the wake-up call when I realized it didn't serve our diverse user base,
  such as individuals with disabilities. This experience taught me the importance
  of considering the needs of all users, even those who may be marginalized or overlooked,
  and highlighted the impact of unconscious bias on well-intentioned projects.</p>\n
  <p>The talk will explore actionable strategies to recognize and mitigate unconscious
  bias in product development and community building, drawing from my personal experience.
  Attendees will learn how to better understand the needs and experiences of individuals
  from diverse backgrounds, resulting in more inclusive and supportive environments.
  My aim is to inspire and empower others to apply these approaches in their own projects
  and contribute to creating more inclusive communities.</p>\n<p>This talk is open
  to everyone (No background knowledge needed)!</p>\n<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>\n
