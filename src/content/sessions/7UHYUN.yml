title: Wrapping up the Cruft - Making Wrappers to Hide Complexity
abstract: "<p>When working with students, the goal is to teach them how to think about
  systems, logic, and problem solving, not just rote memorisation, or copying boilerplate
  code from an example.</p>\n<p>This talk is about how writing wrappers around the
  cruft can help you present your students with an approachable interface to make
  learning to program easy, fun, and effective.</p>"
description: "<p>This year and last, we have been working with the Kookaberries, microcomputers
  produced by the AustSTEM Foundation.</p>\n<p>We’ve used these with great success
  to teach students of a wide variety of ages.</p>\n<p>To facilitate this, we’ve implemented
  wrappers around various peripherals, components, and pre-existing libraries. These
  standardise and simplify the code that the students need to write, so they can solve
  larger and more interesting problems, and get more excited about the possibilities.</p>\n
  <p>In this talk, I'll go through what this entails, what the wrappers look like,
  and what this has enabled our students to do, creating projects far larger and more
  exciting than previously possible.</p>"
