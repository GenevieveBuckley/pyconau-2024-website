abstract: <p>Imagine performing a basic python API call to load observations of the
  natural environment from any sensor at any part of the spectrum, any where in space-time
  since we started digitizing this information. This is what opendatacube aspires
  to do using its signature <strong>datacube.load()</strong> command. This talk will
  cover some history/ architecture of this project and publicly deployed instance
  of datacubes where this dream is being implemented a continent at a time.</p>
description: "<p>In the last decade a large amount of earth observation data has become
  available from national space agencies and commercial providers in cloud native
  formats. However accessing this data over space-time windows in a convenient way
  has become more and more complex as each agency sets up independent data holding
  patterns and image locations. </p>\n<p>Open Data Cube (ODC) is an open source project
  that was born from a Geoscience Australia\nprogram, the \"Australian Geoscience
  Data Cube\". The core code base moved to the Open Data Cube\nopen source project
  in 2017. The aspires to be always 100% opensource, free for all to use and released
  under an Apache 2.0 license. OpenDataCube aims to provide a common Python API for
  array based access of these data holdings. There are infracode aspects for running
  a scalable ODC instance on the various cloud providers using managed databases and
  kubernetes clusters as well.</p>\n<p>This talk covers various aspects of OpenDataCube
  design. Sample environments where OpenDataCube instances have been deployed and
  typical use-cases for which it is a great fit.\nOpenDataCube overlaps with XArray
  and Dask in everyday use and some aspects of these libraries are also covered.</p>\n
  <p>Lastly some enhancement proposals are discussed that could use community contributions
  at a technical level. Various Australian and international government and private
  organisations continue to employ core developers. As for any open-source project
  PR's are welcome from everyone.</p>"
