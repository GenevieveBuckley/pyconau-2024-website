abstract: <p>What's the Minimum Viable Incident Response Protocol?  Come find out!</p>
description: "<p>What happens at your company when a service goes down? Hopefully
  an alarm fires somewhere and someone gets paged, but then what? Does the person
  who got paged fix it all themselves (and do they feel as isolated as that sounds)?
  What if they don’t know how- is there a procedure for them to get help? Do you have
  a protocol for deciding when the incident is over?</p>\n<p>More and more, most of
  us work at companies that provide a service. Even if you’re a game dev or you work
  at a retailer, the way you interface with your customers is a web service, and services
  have outages. Let’s talk about the basics of incident response- what it is, how
  it helps, how to learn more. I can't fix all your problems in a 30m talk, but I
  can help get you going in the right direction!</p>"
