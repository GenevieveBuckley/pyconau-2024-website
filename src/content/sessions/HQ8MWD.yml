title: A Recent History of Python Through Stack Overflow Questions and Answers
abstract: "<p>From Python 0.9's public release in 1991 it has grown to be one of the
  most\nwidely used programming languages, including prominence in many domains from\n
  web apps to machine learning. While there is never going to be any single\nexplanation
  of why or how Python reached this point, Python's past can help\ninform our collective
  future. In this talk I will introduce a novel Python\ntool for interactive text
  analytics to tell a recent history of Python, as\nseen through the Python questions
  and answers on Stack Overflow.</p>"
description: "<p>If you've searched the web to solve a programming related issue you've\n
  probably come across Stack Overflow, the programmer focused question and\nanswer
  site. Stack Overflow questions and answers are contributed by a\ncommunity of users
  and represent a large body of public and openly licensed\ndata about how Python
  is used by a particular group of programmers. Stack\nOverflow's high ranking in
  search results and associated web traffic gives\nthe site prominence for programmers
  beyond the narrow demographics of\nStack Overflow itself.</p>\n<p>As of writing
  there are over two million questions tagged <code>Python</code> on Stack\nOverflow
  - there aren't enough hours in the day to read through that! For\nthis talk I'll
  introduce an approach to computational text analytics as a\nstarting point for making
  sense of all of this data. I'll show off a new\nlibrary for interactive text analytics
  that lets us start tackling data like\nthis with nothing but a laptop. But I'll
  also show that computing alone isn't\nenough! The human work of analysis and interpretation
  is needed to come up\nwith something meaningful that is actually grounded in the
  data.</p>"
