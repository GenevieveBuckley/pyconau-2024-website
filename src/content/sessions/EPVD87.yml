abstract: "<p>Collaborative learning in the classroom has been shown to have a broad
  range of positive academic effects such as promotion of critical thinking, communication
  skills and improved learning outcomes. It also brings social and psychological benefits
  such as development of friendships, social support, reduced anxiety and increased
  appreciation for the course content.</p>\n<p>Unlike a traditional classroom, programming
  education tends to offer few opportunities for group activities as students tend
  to be restricted to their personal laptops  or to allocated workstations and are
  expected to learn in relative isolation. This is often due to environmental factors,
  such as it being hard to share a keyboard between more than two students at a time.
  Additionally, educators often design solo activities, because they are easy to implement
  and execute in the classroom. Since programming students arenâ€™t trained to code
  with other people, they do not develop clear ideas on what good collaborations look
  like or how to collaborate with others successfully, which is an important skill
  in the workforce.</p>\n<p>Pair programming is an oft cited solution, yet sharing
  workstations can be unsatisfying as one student is left in the backseat while the
  other drives. The situation is worsened for larger group sizes. Furthermore, there
  is no ability for a group of students to divide and conquer a problem as their attention
  and input must be the same as the driver.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce approaches
  to collaborative programming that extend beyond pair programming by allowing more
  than two students to collaborate in real-time on projects ranging from single Python
  scripts, to multi-file projects and Jupyter Notebooks. This has been accomplished
  across pairs, small groups, and even entire classrooms during both live classroom
  environments and for long-term group projects. We will also discuss the lessons
  we learnt along the way, as well as feedback from other educators and students.</p>"
