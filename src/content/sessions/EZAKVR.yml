abstract: <p>Every developer makes mistakes while developing new things and experiments.
  We at StackGuardian (IaC platform) wrote everything from scratch and in the process,
  we did a lot of research and experiments to build scalable Django Apps with Microservice
  Architecture. I’ve learned a lot about what works well and what doesn’t with Django,
  and hope I can share some useful tips on how to work with this popular web framework.</p>
description: "<p>History: \nI started using Python in school and started developing
  apps with Django in 2018. To enhance my experience and learnings I also worked at
  an Infrastructure as Code Platform StackGuardian. It’s an OpenSource robust and
  scalable platform built with Django. We wrote everything from scratch and in the
  process, we did a lot of research and experiments to build scalable Django Apps
  with Microservice Architecture. I’ve learned a lot about what works well and what
  doesn’t with Django, and hope I can share some useful tips on how to work with this
  popular web framework.</p>\n<p>Agenda for the Talk:</p>\n<p>--&gt; Monoliths &amp;
  Microservices Brief Intro &amp; general misconception \nI’ll start with a layman's
  introduction to Monoliths &amp; Microservices so that even beginners get the idea
  about the terminologies which will be used later. I will also touch upon the common
  misconception junior engineers or students have about these architectures.</p>\n
  <p>--&gt; Moving away from Monolith\nUnder this, I’ll be discussing problems with
  Monolith Architecture or monolith Django Apps. What does it take to move away from
  a monolith architecture? Examples of companies that moved from Monolith to Microservice
  architecture.</p>\n<p>→ Why Microservices usage skyrocketed?\nReal-world instances
  of organizations that skyrocketed after switching to Microservices architecture.
  I’ll be sharing the strategies or high-level changes added. </p>\n<p>--&gt; Why
  Django for Microservices &amp; Mistakes to Avoid or Best Practices\nUnderstanding
  Microservice Architecture in Django via a reference app. How to transition your
  Django App from a Monolith App to a Microservices-based app. I’ll discuss about
  the mistakes every django should avoid or best practices that we at Stackguardian
  realized with time for a robust &amp; scalable platform.</p>\n<p>–&gt; StackGuardian
  overview &amp; Tirith\nIn this, I’ll give a bird's eye view of StackGuardian’s architecture
  and how its open-source tool “Tirith” built with python will help security engineers
  to write policies in a human-readable way but still machine enforceable. </p>\n
  <p>--&gt; Key Takeaway &amp; Django Trivia/QnA\nI’ll conclude the talk with fun
  Django Trivia.</p>"
