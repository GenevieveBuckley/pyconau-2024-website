title: 'HttpRequest: An unsung hero of Django'
abstract: <p>We use it in every view, every request, but how much is HttpRequest doing
  for you that you never thought about?</p>
description: "<p>One of the key strengths of Django is protecting us from the dangerous
  things: the non obvious hazards, the common tedious work, the foot-guns of the whole
  wild web.</p>\n<p>Take a tour through HttpRequest, that cornerstone of every Django
  view, and see all the work you never realised it did for you.</p>"
