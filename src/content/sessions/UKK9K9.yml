abstract: <p>Templating is awesome! It makes automation easier and takes away a lot
  of the tedious work required to maintain and build new things. Now, what if I told
  you that the way we utilise templates is somewhat similar to how songs are written?
  In this talk I will lower the proverbial gangplank from our templating ship as we
  cross over into the land of song writing and discover how these two concepts are
  linked.</p>
