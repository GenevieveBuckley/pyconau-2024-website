title: 'CountESS: Count-based Experiment Scoring and Statistics'
abstract: <p>CountESS is a new visual programming toolkit for data processing in bioinformatics.  It
  aims to make complicated data processing pipelines easy to set up and replicate,
  but also easy to modify, explore and extend (in Python)</p>
description: "<p>Bioinformatics is a young field whose gene sequencing technologies
  are rapidly improving â€” consequently its need for data processing is increasing
  too.  At the same time, researchers want to concentrate on research, not on programming,
  so there is a demand for tools which will enable them to get on with their jobs.</p>\n
  <p>CountESS attempts to resolve this issue by providing a graphical framework for
  data processing, allowing processing pipelines to be constructed from a graph of
  modules. Within this framework, new techniques can be implemented as Python plugins
  using existing Pandas (etc) libraries.  A simple configuration file format allows
  data processing to be replicated, modified and applied to new data sets easily.
  </p>\n<p>We'll look at how CountESS is being used in cancer research and how you
  can use CountESS in other fields, and/or contribute to its development and expansion.</p>"

  variations we're studying, but not in detail.</p>\n<p>Details of cell biology may
  make you feel weird about Eukaryotic life, including yourself.</p>"
