abstract: <p>Ever wanted to use your favourite C++ libraries in your Python? This
  talk will discuss different ways of generating bindings to C++ libraries, including
  the approaches that the RobotPy project has used over many years.</p>
description: "<p>RobotPy gives over 50 teams of high school students competing in
  the FIRST Robotics Competition the ability to write robot code in Python.</p>\n
  <p>This talk will explore different popular solutions generating bindings to C++,
  including SWIG and pybind11, and introduce some projects that automatically generate
  binding code, including robotpy-build, RobotPy's own solution to generate pybind11
  code. We'll also discuss some of the complexities around library dependencies, making
  sure the bindings feel Pythonic, and publishing to PyPI.</p>"
