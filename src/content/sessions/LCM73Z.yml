abstract: "<p>Ever been in a situation where you've hastily written a bunch of code,
  just to make something \"work\"?</p>\n<p>Have you then trembled with fear, looking
  at your single, thousand line file, with global variables, multi parameter functions,
  and zero classes, not knowing where to start?</p>\n<p>Or do you question why changing
  your complex code and fixing bugs takes so long?</p>\n<p>Then come and learn about
  how refactoring can not only be fun and educational, but also profitable!</p>"
description: "<p>Often in programming projects, we find ourselves building layers
  and layers on top of a starting idea, without having been able to think about the
  long term design.</p>\n<p>And that's fine! But unless push comes to shove, we often
  don't get the time or incentive to sit down and clean it up, especially if it all
  works.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll discuss why you should care about good pythonic
  code, and how refactoring can not only be profitable, but also a fun and educational
  experience!</p>\n<p>We'll look at easy to use tools and techniques that Python offers
  to make the process of refactoring faster and future proof for you.</p>\n<p>And
  finally, we'll cover some design principles and methodologies for you to keep in
  mind, alongside understandable real world examples.</p>"
