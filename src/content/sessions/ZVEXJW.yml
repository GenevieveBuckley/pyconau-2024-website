abstract: <p>APIs and events are complementary to each other and are deeply connected
  in the architecture of your domain. Understanding this insight will help you design
  better systems.</p>
description: <p>You might have heard of event-driven architecture - that's the hot
  new way of integrating your systems using streaming messages and loosely-couple
  publish/subscribe. You've probably heard of APIs, that's the "old" way of integrating
  your systems using request/reply messages. You might be asking, which one should
  I use? The answer is both! APIs and events are complementary to each other and are
  deeply connected in the architecture of your domain. This talk will provide ways
  to think about your domain design, about APIs and events. The insight will help
  you to design better systems.</p>
