title: Maths Whimsy with Python
abstract: <p>The more whimsy the better. First, it's about having fun solving interesting
  problems, and second it's about breaking projects down into manageable chunks and
  harvesting useful results. Also Python.</p>
description: "<p>I've always enjoyed coding interesting maths and data problems, and
  in the last few years I've done this many times over in the Python ecosystem. This
  talk will highlight some projects, and also explore why I choose particular problems,
  how I broke down the work into manageable chunks, and how I harvested useful results.
  In the process, it will explore how to integrate play in your work.</p>\n<p>Project
  highlights include weird gravity, atypical visualisations, solving puzzle toys,
  graph processing in various domains, AI wheelie coaches, and more. I'll share the
  mathematical basis, the Python libraries used and my experience with them in each
  case. In sharing my approaches with the audience, I also hope to learn how I could
  have solved these problems better!</p>\n<p>By reflecting on each project, I'll build
  general considerations for what makes an \"interesting\" problem, strategies for
  breaking down the work in order to see progress and create intermediate results,
  and how to find practical applications for the outputs. I hope these considerations
  will help the audience find ways to combine their own playful interests with their
  work.</p>"
