abstract: <p>As says the famous Brett Cannon quote, some people “come for the language,
  but stay for the community”. Usually it starts out participating in local meet ups,
  or focused groups like PyLadies, and sometimes we want to help, but we’re not exactly
  sure on how to do so. And moving even further, there is the possibility of extending
  our work not only locally but also helping communities all around the globe. In
  this talk, we will discuss ways we can cooperate within the Python community in
  movements  that can be done both locally and outside our country on a voluntary
  basis.</p>

  globe. In this talk, we will discuss ways we can cooperate within the Python community
  in movements  that can be done both locally and outside our country on a voluntary
  basis.</p>\n<p>To begin with, we’ll discuss what contributing to the community is,
  and the different ways you can contribute. Moreover, we’ll explain a little about
  the Python Software Foundation and its working groups, the role of these groups
  and how to proceed if you’re interested in getting in touch and help. We’ll emphasize
  the work of the Diversity and Inclusion group and also the translation working group
  and their importance to the broader community.</p>\n<p>Some works that are in progress
  will also be presented, such as the massive work of our Latin American colleagues
  with Python en Español, which has a Discord and a Telegram group to study and cooperate
  together. Another success case to be presented is that the Brazilian Python gathering
  Python Brasil strove during 2020 and 2021 due to international cooperation: a Brazilian
  woman cooperating with EuroPython 2020 led us the way.</p>\n<p>We'll talk about
  how important it is to see someone like us, who speaks the same language as us,
  occupying these spaces and taking our concerns to other discussion tables. And that
  if there isn't someone who looks like us, there is a place we can occupy.</p>"
