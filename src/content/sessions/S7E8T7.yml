abstract: <p>Come and hear how I wrote 3 Django apps in a trenchcoat to run a ~300+
  person scout camp, from making event registration a breeze, to conducting everyone's
  movements throughout the entire event.</p>
description: '<p>In the last weekend of April this year, I helped to run Star Trek:
  Survival (https://startreksurvival.tech), a STEM-focussed, Star Trek-themed scout
  camp for all ages, 5 to 26 years. This talk will be about the software I wrote,
  including a registration system, the Star Trek Survival main website, and a system
  called RadioActiv8, which is used to keep track of where everyone is across the
  campsite, and send them to activities when there is capacity to do so. All of this
  was combined into a single project for maximum integration and ease of use.</p>'
