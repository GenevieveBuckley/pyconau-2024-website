abstract: <p>Delve into the world of digital rights in Australia, where tech, politics
  and human rights combine.</p>
description: "<p>Amidst the latest wave of AI hype, the evolution of social media,
  and political posturing about “world-leading” legislation to “crack down” on Big
  Tech, Australian leaders and policymakers appear to be scrambling to respond to
  the challenges and opportunities of the digital economy. As tech giants race for
  profit, we find ourselves in a relentless tug-of-war between innovation and regulation.
  And despite all the rhetoric of ethics and safety, too often we’re presented with
  reactive, inconsistent, or technically-incoherent policy. </p>\n<p>In this battle
  of egos, what becomes of our digital rights? And how can we collectively forge a
  socially progressive digital future in Australia? </p>\n<p>Join activist, writer
  and Digital Rights Watch Program Lead, Sam Floreani, for the TL;DR of tech policy
  and digital rights in Australia. From the sisyphean push for privacy law reform
  to resisting surveillance; from navigating the complexity of online safety to new
  frontiers in the Crypto Wars—there is never a dull moment fighting to protect digital
  rights in Australia. Find out what the heck is happening, why safeguarding digital
  rights matters, and how technologists can join the fight.</p>"
