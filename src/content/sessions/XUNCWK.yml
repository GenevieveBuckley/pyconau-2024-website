abstract: "<p>Live cell imaging is a microscopy technique, where scientists can observe
  dynamics of living cells across time. One such method, known as lattice lightsheet
  microscopy captures these processes at high spatiotemporal detail. However, current
  analyses methods do not always capture the complexities of these feature rich datasets.
  \nIn this talk, I will use an example of programmed cell death, where cells are
  exposed to different drugs. Using python packages, such as scikit-image and tsfresh,\
  \  I will demonstrate how we extract morphological and spatiotemporal features of
  cells. We use these features to train a supervised machine learning (ML) model to
  predict which drug treatment the cells were exposed to. \nFurthermore, using explainable
  AI with Shapley values, we identify key feature combinations that distinguish the
  cellular response to each drug. This approach enables data-driven hypothesis generation,
  allowing us to infer underlying phenotypes and correlate them to the biological
  processes.</p>"
