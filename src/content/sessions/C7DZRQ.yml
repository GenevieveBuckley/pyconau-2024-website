abstract: <p>h5pydantic is a Pydantic based library used to describe the layout of
  HDF5 files using Python models, in a similar way to how SQLAlchemy models are used
  to describe the layout of an SQL database. HDF5 files are structured binary files,
  designed to store science and mathematical data.</p>
description: "<p>This talk will cover:\n * Providing scientific software support when
  you're not an expert in the scientific field.\n * Python dataclasses, and the related
  Pydantic library.\n * HDF5 files, what are they, when should they be used.\n * How
  to build on top of Pydantic, and the design decisions that you'll have to make.\n
  * How to test data transformation code automatically.</p>"
