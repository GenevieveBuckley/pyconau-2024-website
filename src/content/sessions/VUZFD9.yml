abstract: <p>Increasing awareness of personal data stored on centralised servers and
  individual need to access personal data in a connected world is driving the development
  of frameworks to support data sovereignty and privacy. The Australian National Universityâ€™s
  Software Innovation Institute is collaborating with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service
  (Gurriny) in the Yarrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland, Australia, to
  build privacy focused data infrastructure and associated software applications called
  the Solid Health System which will provide individuals with storage, ownership,
  and control over their own health data.  This model is using Social Linked Data
  (Solid) technology, a decentralised data storage specification for software application
  development, using open standards mostly developed by the World Wide Web Consortium
  (W3C). Open source Solid server provides users with a secure online storage space
  called a personal online datastore (POD) to store their own data with granular control
  of data sharing using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one environment.
  Cross-platform software applications are being developed with the Dart and Flutter
  framework to interact with PODS on a data pipeline built with Python.</p>
description: <p>Indigenous controlled health care clinics such as Gurriny are providing
  whole of person care, requiring the integrated view of the patient's medical, health,
  social, and cultural data to better support the patient to manage their health in
  a complex environment of multiple social determinants impacting health. Using a
  PODs-based app, the patient can maintain control over their highly personal data,
  and can access personalised health information that supports a strength rather than
  deficit-based approach to health care. Health and health-related data are both collected
  by and shared with the individual enabling patient centred connected data that is
  required to provide integrated health care services needed for the treatment of
  chronic diseases. Gurriny will use this PODs-based digital infrastructure to integrate
  and analyse patient data to provide personalised holistic point-of-care health services
  and develop the evidence to understand and innovate integrated health care for chronic
  disease. This presentation will explain how Solid PODs work and outline how to build
  PODs-based software applications.</p>
