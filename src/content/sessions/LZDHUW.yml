abstract: <p>What is gender? It is easy to imagine gender as a linear spectrum, but
  in my research I have explored the concept that gender is more like a three dimensional
  spectrum of color. I posit that we all experience gender slightly differently, just
  like we experience color slightly differently. Therefore, I built an online project
  using Python and Flask to classify people as individual colors rather than genders,
  to create a tapestry of gender. and show gender as a literal, individual, spectrum.</p>
description: <p>Gender tapestry is an online art project that encourages us to consider
  how we think about gender classification. This talk will be an exploration of the
  development of my PhD project Gender Tapestry where I created a gender classifier
  that assigns unique colors to people, rather than genders. This work is an interactive
  online project written in python with a custom Keras multi-label classifier, flask
  and integrations for a projection based live work. This talk will explore my development
  and planning of this work, the joys of learning Flask and Django, GAN and mosaic
  integration and will include an ongoing live demonstration of the work. I will also
  discuss what this work means for gender and gender classification and why machine
  learning is an ideal medium to interrogate machine learning.</p>

  isn't great for colorblind people.</p>"
