title: Are we singing sillier?
track:
abstract: <p>Everyone has heard it from someone... "Music was better in my day". As
  a parent of teenagers, I'm pretty sure I've even said it. But who's right? Which
  decade's pop music is linguisitcally more interesting, and is there a trend? Using
  Python and some text analysis I will attempt to answer these questions and more.
  By the end of the talk all will be revealed... and we can happily sing along to
  some pop songs safe in the knowledge that they are linguisitcally superior.</p>
description: "<p>I will use the time to break down the process of discovering the
  answer to the question \"is pop music less linguistically complex these days\".
  What questions did I come up with to drive my investigation? What language processing
  did I do? How does it break down by genre? This is an interesting investigation
  that has lots of examples that will encourage debate in the audience and hopefully
  we'll take the arguments out into the next break. \nI will use Python and Pandas
  and a couple of libraries to show the process of the language analysis of the lyrics
  of the top songs each year since the 50s.  By the end everyone will know what the
  data shows about linguistic complexity of pop lyrics and will have had some fun
  along the way.</p>"
