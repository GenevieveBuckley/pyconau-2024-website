abstract: <p>“The website is slow”. These four words can strike fear and dread in
  the heart of any developer. Load Testing is a tool for preparing your website for
  high demand, but designing a good load test is a fine-art. In this talk, we’ll explore
  how design effective load tests for web apps in Python</p>
description: <p>In this talk you’ll learn how to design and run load tests on a web
  application to simulate and scale user traffic. The goal is to prepare for high
  demand and peak load by better understanding your application, where its bottlenecks
  are and where you can optimise without throwing more hardware at the problem. Even
  if you’re not planning for millions of users, a few bottlenecks and a surge in traffic
  can bring any Python web application to its knees. With the right knowledge and
  tools, you can model and simulate user traffic to prepare and optimise your app
  before the rush.</p>
