abstract: <p>Marathon training daunting, but using data, together with some simple
  python software, can make it slightly less so. In this talk, I will share my own
  story about how I used python to attempt to take my marathon training to the next
  level. The talk will explore how to collect and analyze your running data, improve
  your training plan and potentially even predict race day performance using machine
  learning tools. I hope to inspire some fellow runners and leave people thinking
  about how they can use python in their own personal endeavors.</p>
description: "<p>I recently completed my first marathon, and like many other keen
  runners/driven software engineers may have done, as soon as I crossed the finish
  line I started to ask myself how I could do it better next time? </p>\n<p>In this
  talk, I will walk through possible ways to improve marathon training and performance
  by integrating python into your training plan. I will explore how data analysis
  and machine learning can be leveraged to improve your training efficiency and reduce
  the possibility of injury while running, all while utilizing standard python libraries
  like pandas, NumPy and maybe even scikit-learn. </p>\n<p>I will use practical examples
  and anecdotes from my own experiences to discuss how best to use real-time monitoring
  and feedback to make your own exercise training more insightful and perhaps a bit
  more interesting. Join me to see how Python can transform your running journey and
  help you hit your goals!</p>"
