title: Building 3D Trusted Data Pipelines With Dagster, Dbt, and Duckdb
track: data
abstract: "<p>This talk will demonstrate an example of building trusted data pipelines
  with 3D packages: Dagster, Dbt, and Duckdb. First, it presents the importance of
  testing data pipelines from high levels (like tables, relations, â€¦) to low levels
  (like rows and columns). It then discusses when and what we need to test. After
  that, I will show how to implement these tests using different Dbt packages, including
  dbt-audit-helper, dbt-utils, and dbt-expectations.</p>\n<p>Finally, a demo with
  a complete ELT workflow will be presented. In this demo, Dagster is used as a data
  pipeline orchestrator, and Dbt is utilized for data transformation with its related
  testing packages. These transformed pipelines sit on top of Duckdb, which acts as
  a small data warehouse. This demo is published in a GitHub repository, allowing
  developers to clone and run the demo independently. </p>\n<p>The talk will help
  data and analytics engineers build more robust tests for their data pipelines. These
  trusted data pipelines could enhance the data quality and validation process, reducing
  the risk of other data issues like data drift for downstream channels.</p>"
