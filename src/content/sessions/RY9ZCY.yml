abstract: "<p>This talk will demonstrate an example of building trusted data pipelines
  with 3D packages: Dagster, Dbt, and Duckdb. First, it presents the importance of
  trusted data pipelines by testing data quality. It then discusses what we need to
  test data quality, from high levels (like tables, relations, â€¦) to low levels (like
  rows and columns). After that, I will show how to implement these tests using different
  Dbt packages like dbt-utils and dbt-expectations.</p>\n<p>Finally, a demo with a
  complete ELT workflow will be presented. In this demo, Dagster is used as a data
  pipeline orchestrator, and Dbt is utilized for data transformation with its related
  testing packages. These transformed pipelines sit on top of Duckdb, which acts as
  a small data warehouse. This demo is published in a GitHub repository, allowing
  developers to clone and run the demo independently. </p>\n<p>The talk will help
  data and analytics engineers build more robust tests for their data pipelines. These
  trusted data pipelines could enhance the data quality and validation process, reducing
  the risk of other data issues like data drift for downstream channels.</p>"
