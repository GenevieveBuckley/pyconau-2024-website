  One thing I wonder after solving the puzzle for the day is whether I made a bad
  choice of words. Should I have chosen SMASH, or STASH? Just how lucky was I to solve
  a puzzle?</p>\n<p>The good news is that writing a bot to solve Wordle — or, if you’d
  prefer, give a statistical review of how well you played — is quite easy to do,
  but the first implementation you might write in Python will probably be quite slow:
  there’s lots of words to choose from, and figuring out which word might be a good
  guess depends on comparing against a lot of other words.</p>\n<p>The good news is
  that these sorts of tests are things that can be sped up by parallel processing,
  and Python has some tools that can help with this.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll discuss
  a simplified implementation of the algorithm used by the New York Times’ Wordlebot,
  and then we’ll look at speeding it up using Python’s concurrency tools. We’ll look
  at making small changes to use the <code>concurrent.futures</code> package, to see
  the performance difference between thread pools and process pools; we’ll look at
  what structural changes you might make to use Python’s <code>async</code> functions;
  and we’ll finish off by looking at the <code>nogil</code> branch of Python to see
  how this impacts our performance.</p>\n<p>This talk is a fun way to look at how
  Python performs at concurrent processing tasks, and what future development in Python
  might have for problems like this one. And while there’ll be a small amount of maths
  involved, it shouldn’t be enough to scare you off.</p>\n<p>And nothing in this talk
  will spoil today’s Wordle. Or tomorrow’s. I promise.</p>"
