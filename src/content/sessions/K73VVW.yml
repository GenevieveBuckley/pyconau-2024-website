title: The Python 3D Visualisation Landscape
abstract: <p>A survey of packages in the Python ecosystem for real-time 3D rendering
  and data visualisation</p>
description: <p>This talk will give an overview of the ecosystem for real-time 3D
  rendering packages in Python. It will talk to trade offs between higher and lower
  level abstraction APIs, browser-based versus platform specific hardware rendering,
  and different use cases for 3D rendering from desktop application views, Jupyter
  and/or browser based views, and support for exporting 3D renders to other formats.</p>
