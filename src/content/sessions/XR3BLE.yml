abstract: "<p>Through various practical experiences and case studies, this talk aims
  to share with professional software engineers the output and expectations of \"\
  seniority\" in code submission (pull-request) and code review at each stage of software
  development.</p>\n<p>Specifically, it covers:\n1. Key points of writing and reviewing
  Python code.\n2. Related environment, tools, and methods.</p>\n<p>In the summary,
  the talk will also move from the perspective of a senior engineer's Python code
  review to the communication, learning, sharing, and recruitment within an organization.
  Enough time will be assured for Q&amp;A by best effort.</p>"
description: "<p>This talk shares two aspects with professional software engineers
  when submitting code (pull-request) and undergoing review (code review):</p>\n<ol>\n
  <li>Key points of writing and reviewing Python code.</li>\n<li>Python software development
  environment, tools, and methods related to the first point.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Approximately
  half of the content will discuss the differences between senior and non-senior engineers
  through many real-world submitted Python code examples. For example: whether to
  write comments, when to comment, concise or redundant variables and functions, harmful
  naming, useless code, common Python errors and debugging, and their underlying principles,
  Python style, and the relationship with Zen of Python.</p>\n<p>The other half of
  the content will revolve around creating a good environment for submitting Python
  code, such as Python cloud application design review, CI/CD, Code Coverage, advanced
  Python learning, and AI-assisted development emerging this year. Through some practical
  case studies, it will provide references on how professional software developers
  and senior engineers might approach these topics.;</p>\n<p>In summary, moving forward
  from the perspective of a senior engineer's Python code review, the talk will also
  cover practical aspects of communication, learning, sharing, and recruitment within
  an organization, and leave enough time for Q&amp;A.</p>"
