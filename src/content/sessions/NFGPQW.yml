abstract: "<p>Using Git and GitHub for version control are industry essentials for
  any aspiring developer and open-source contributor, but do students even need to
  learn this “tricky” process? But, GitHub has more to offer teachers and students
  than just version control (although the peace of mind of knowing that those major
  works are safe and secure on the cloud is a big bonus!). </p>\n<p>I’ll tell you
  why using Git is just like an Instagram-worthy shopping trip, and with this analogy
  and some tools using GitHub will soon be child's play. I’ll also show you the tools
  for teachers to help keep your students on track, from project templates to documentation,
  and automated testing with GitHub Actions and some quick Python scripts.</p>"
description: "<p>In this talk, I’ll show how I make Git approachable for new users
  with my analogy comparing code-add-commit-push to an Instragram worthy shopping
  trip, and how it’s easy to get students to use GitHub with inbuilt tools like VS
  Code extensions (or those you find in GitHub.dev). </p>\n<p>To help students get
  on board with the basics and get moving on projects, I’ll show you how to set up
  your own GitHub Templates for creating project scaffolds such as a Python Flask
  app for a portfolio site, bringing students into the world of GitHub in a friendly
  way while ensuring their code is safe in the cloud from the beginning! We’ll also
  discuss how you or your students can leverage the ReadMe or other markdown files
  for teacher instructions or student project documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll
  show you how you can leverage GitHub Actions to run Python scripts on each push,
  encouraging students to take full advantage of GitHub and cloud backups by pushing
  code often, whilst also keeping students on track with automatic checks and tests
  designed by you (or them!).</p>"
