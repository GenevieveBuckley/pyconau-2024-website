abstract: <p>Why do some ideas seem to stick around forever? Why do some ideas seem
  like they've been there forever, even when they haven't? Why do some ideas never
  seem to gain traction, even when they're good?</p>
description: "<p>The way we form ideas, the way we share them, how we use them, and
  how we decide which ones we accept and which we reject is a fascinatingly complex
  area. It's also one that has a lot of interesting links with the way we, as people
  who deal with software a lot, deal with both code and the concepts that go into
  it.</p>\n<p>I've been having ideas about ideas for a while now, and I really look
  forward to sharing them with you.</p>"
