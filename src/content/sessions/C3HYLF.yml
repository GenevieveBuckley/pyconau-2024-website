abstract: <p>Traditional IT operations is overwhelmingly reactive - humans respond
  to incidents and tickets. There is so much noise! Alerts, tickets, audits, chat
  threads. What if ops could catch the small things before they turn into big problems?
  What if we could use events and serverless to remediate issues?</p>
description: "<p>Engineering teams are adopting event driven architectures with herds
  of serverless microservices. Why can’t Ops play buzzword bingo too?</p>\n<p>Most
  significant issues in productions start off as small problems that are overlooked
  or ignored. These small problems are usually can be captured via events. Those events
  can be routed to handlers than can react and remediate the issues.</p>\n<p>During
  this session we will explore what “proactive ops” platform can look like. Areas
  covered in this session will include capturing events from SaaS products, event
  routing, building reusable composable components, and the different approaches to
  deal with policy violations. By then end of session an attendee should be able to
  start building their own serverless, event driven, proactive ops platform.</p>"
