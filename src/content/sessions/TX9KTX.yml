abstract: <p>This talk is a story of how open-source frameworks make it possible for
  academics to take on otherwise infeasibly complex projects, which in my case was
  a new community-driven database for biologists and clinical geneticists.</p>
description: "<p>Almost ten years ago, a couple of professors got together to discuss
  the rapid growth of large datasets in their emerging field and concluded that a
  new database was needed to organize them. They approached me and, emboldened by
  some exciting talks at PyCon AU, I decided to take on this challenge using the Django
  web framework.</p>\n<p>Despite being an academic team with minimal web development
  expertise, we created a database that has become an important resource for biological
  researchers and clinical geneticists all over the world, helping them understand
  how differences in our DNA can affect disease.</p>\n<p>This talk will include an
  introduction to how and why biologists are generating these large datasets. Then
  I’ll describe the evolution of the project starting with the initial data engineering
  and database design, and the development of Django-based prototypes and production
  deployments. Next I’ll discuss how the project survived contact with external users
  and their data submissions, and why we transitioned the project away from Django
  to FastAPI.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll share my experience maintaining (and trying to
  find funding for) a public-facing open-source project within academia, as well as
  make some suggestions for how members of the Python community can get involved with
  ongoing research projects.</p>"
