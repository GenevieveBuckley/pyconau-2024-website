abstract: <p>Increasing awareness of personal data stored on centralised servers and
  individual need to access personal data in a connected world is driving the development
  of frameworks to support data sovereignty and privacy. The Australian National Universityâ€™s
  Software Innovation Institute is collaborating with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service
  (Gurriny) in the Yarrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland, Australia, to
  build privacy focused data infrastructure and associated software applications called
  the Solid Health System which will provide individuals with storage, ownership,
  and control over their own health data.  This model is using Social Linked Data
  (Solid) technology, a decentralised data storage specification for software application
  development, using open standards mostly developed by the World Wide Web Consortium
  (W3C). Open source Solid server provides users with a secure online storage space
  called a personal online datastore (POD) to store their own data with granular control
  of data sharing using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one environment.
  Cross-platform software applications are being developed with the Dart and Flutter
  framework to interact with PODS on a data pipeline built with Python. Here we will
  show how PODs based software work and answer questions about building software with
  PODs.</p>
description: <p>We will use the stall to allow interested people to see how the apps
  work, ask questions about the open source packages for working with SOLID PODs and
  how to build software and consider data governance when working with PODs.</p>
