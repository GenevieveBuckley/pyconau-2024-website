abstract: <p>Django 4.2 introduces a new way of streaming http responses with an ASGI
  server. Let's use this with HTMX to build a traditional web application that provides
  SPA-like real time notifications!</p>
description: "<p>Traditional web applications rely on the request-response model,
  and as a result can only display messages and notifications when the user interacts
  with the page in some, potentially delaying important information. How can we improve
  on this, to provide some of the responsiveness that has made SPA style applications
  so popular over the years?</p>\n<p>Luckily, we have some great tools available these
  days, such as the HTMX library. And in Django 4.2, we can also use a StreamingHttpResponse
  to send Server Sent Events directly to HTMX to be inserted into the page in real-time.</p>\n
  <p>In this talk, we'll walk through the background of Server Sent Events and how
  this feature works, and take a look at an example in a simple Django application,
  showing how notifications can be streamed from a Django view using StreamingHttpResponse,
  and rendered on the page in real-time using HTMX.</p>\n<p>We'll also take a look
  at some of the challenges with this approach, including how to handle removal of
  notifications, and how to make this scale across multiple web server processes.</p>"
