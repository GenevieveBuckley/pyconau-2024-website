title: Learning to Sketch with Differentiable Rendering
abstract: <p>Drawing (or rendering) has long been one of the surprising and amazing
  things computers can do. But what about sketching, are computers any good at it?
  Differentiable Rendering is a technique borrowed from the field of machine learning
  that does exactly that! In this talk we will cover how it works and demo what it
  can do.</p>
description: <p>Differentiable Rendering is a technique that takes the standard machine
  learning pipeline and utilizes it to generate images from vector information such
  as meshes, curves and polygons. The twist is that the "Differentiable" in the name
  means standard machine learning algorithms such as gradient descent can then be
  used to <em>learn</em> how a given image can be created from these building blocks!
  We will cover how to use PyTorch and Python to implement such a renderer with the
  help of automatic gradients, the principles behind how it works and a few things
  that it can do, besides covering what could be built on top of it and how it could
  help artists.</p>
