title: 'Real-time Map Imagery Manipulation with Python, Slippy Maps, Flask, and Pillow:
  Building Interactive Maps with Dynamic Tiles'
track: data
abstract: <p>This talk will demonstrate how to build interactive maps with Python,
  using slippy map tiles, Flask, and Pillow. We will create a Flask server to retrieve
  tiles and show how to manipulate them with Pillow, adding filters and overlays to
  map images in real-time without needing to regenerate the tiles. Attendees will
  gain insights into building more engaging and dynamic maps, leveraging the power
  of these powerful Python libraries.</p>
description: "<p>its libraries. It will begin with an introduction to slippy maps,
  a popular web map architecture that uses pre-rendered image tiles for seamless panning
  and zooming, and demonstrate how to generate these tiles using GDAL, an open-source
  geospatial tool. The session will then delve into the manipulation of map images
  using Pillow, a powerful Python imaging library, with a focus on adding filters
  and overlays, such as dynamic watermarks, to the tiles in real-time.</p>\n<p>In
  the subsequent section, the speaker will showcase some practical applications of
  this technology, including adding watermarks to maps to safeguard data and adjusting
  the brightness or darkness of imagery to highlight features or improve visibility.
  Throughout the talk, attendees will learn how to serve maps using a lightweight
  Flask application, providing a simple way to share maps over the web. By the end
  of the session, participants will gain a solid understanding of how to create engaging
  and dynamic maps using Python, slippy maps, Flask, and Pillow, which can be implemented
  in web applications or data visualisation projects.</p>"
