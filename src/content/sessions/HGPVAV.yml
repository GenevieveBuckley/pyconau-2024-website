abstract: <p>This talk will demonstrate how to build interactive maps with Python,
  using slippy map tiles, Flask, and Pillow. We will create a Flask server to retrieve
  tiles and show how to manipulate them with Pillow, adding filters and overlays to
  map images in real-time without needing to regenerate the tiles. Attendees will
  gain insights into building more engaging and dynamic maps, leveraging the power
  of these powerful Python libraries.</p>
description: "<p>In this session, we embark on a journey to transform and serve large
  image datasets seamlessly for web applications.</p>\n<p>Our initial focus will be
  on converting a substantial image dataset into the Slippy Tiles format. Then after
  having transformed our data, we'll delve into efficient storage methods, guiding
  attendees on how to store these tiles in a cloud storage solution, ensuring scalability
  and ease of access.</p>\n<p>Next, we'll shift our attention to the creation of an
  API endpoint with Flask. This will allow users to access the stored map tiles seamlessly.
  But we wonâ€™t stop there! We'll enhance this endpoint with powerful functionalities
  to modify the byte stream data in real-time, opening avenues for dynamic interactions
  and manipulations.</p>\n<p>By the end of this session, participants will possess
  the skills to effectively transform large image datasets, store them in the cloud,
  and serve them through a dynamic API endpoint. This knowledge equips attendees to
  create more interactive and responsive map-based applications and visualisations.</p>"
