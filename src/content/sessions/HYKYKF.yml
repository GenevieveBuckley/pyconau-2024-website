abstract: <p>Open source researchers are increasingly challenged while navigating
  the data which open source communities inherently create when working in the open.
  While mining software repositories for insights into open source practices isn't
  new, moving beyond code analysis into ecosystems-level research does not have a
  clear path. This talk will outline the current ethical, legal, and policy challenges
  community leaders, as well as researchers in academia and industry face and the
  ambiguous areas decision makers should be aware of.</p>
