abstract: "<p>Cricket, with over two billion fanbases worldwide, is the second most
  popular sport after soccer. Unfortunately, like other sporting events, cricket matches
  were heavily affected during the Covid-19 pandemic. To compensate for the lack of
  live cricket matches, the initial part of this project was done during the pandemic
  to generate a fantasy T20 cricket match simulating events (runs, dots, fours, sixes,
  wickets, etc.) based on the batter and bowler's career statistics.</p>\n<p>The work
  has been further extended to simulate the entire Fifty Overs Cricket World Cup using
  Python. As a part of the PyCon Fair Stall, I plan to share a poster detailing the
  techniques used in the simulation, simulation results, and the potential application
  of the work to predict the outcome of a cricket match. I also plan to live-stream
  (scores only) a demo simulated cricket match, potentially the finals of the simulated
  Fifty Overs Cricket World Cup.</p>"

  poster presentation session during PyCon-US 2023. Please find the link to the poster
