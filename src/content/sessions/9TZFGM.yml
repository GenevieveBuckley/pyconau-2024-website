title: Our Dependency on Open Source Dependencies
abstract: "<p>Chances are you've come across at least a few articles talking about
  \"software supply chains,\" \"SBOMs,\" or \"open source dependencies.\" </p>\n<p>If
  you've read any of these articles and have no idea what it means or want to learn
  something new - you've come to the right place. </p>\n<p>We will give you a crash
  course into the commotion over open-source software security, the organizations
  paying attention to it, and why you should pay attention to the billions of dollars
  pledged to tackle this problem.</p>"
