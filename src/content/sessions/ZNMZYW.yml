title: Unpacking the geospatial engineering toolbox – an overview of data science
  techniques for spatial data
abstract: <p>This talk is an introductory dive into the world of spatial data in data
  science. We will discuss how we use python to massage and process objects and buildings'
  shapes and locations, in order to solve problems such as determining accessibility
  to buildings and roads, bulk processing of spatial geometries at scale, or asset
  maintenance optimization. Whether you are a seasoned GIS professional or new to
  spatial data, this talk offers insights, potential speed-ups, and new project ideas.
  Come along, even if you think spatial data is not your thing – it is an interesting
  corner of data science you will want to know about!</p>
description: "<p>Data Science frequently deals far more with algorithms and data processing
  than statistical modelling, especially if you are in a field with limited data or
  special formats. One of these is spatial data, commonly seen if you work in infrastructure
  and other engineering fields. Shapes and locations of the objects that shape our
  lives such as buildings, properties, lots, roads, fences, vehicles, etc. are the
  source of both our insights – where should we place new schools to maximize impact,
  or what properties may present challenging accessibility problems – and the source
  of our pain – because geometries, just like any other data, are messy and irregular;
  they take up a lot of memory with thousands of coordinates; they require conceptually
  different approaches compared to the more ubiquitous tabular, text, or image data;
  and there are many algorithms out there that you need to be familiar with to solve
  your issues.  </p>\n<p>This talk is a guide through the world of Python libraries
  and techniques for handling spatial data using real examples we solved in our daily
  work, such as determination of accessibility, asset maintenance optimization and
  bulk processing at high computational speed and with good code quality. While some
  of these will be familiar to people in the GIS field, we, as data scientists, are
  more interested in incorporating geospatial data at scale, leveraging automation
  where we can in our data processing and ML pipelines. If you work with spatial data
  in any capacity, this talk may give you some ideas for algorithms, speed-ups or
  even new project ideas you can try, and if you don’t see yourself needing to work
  with spatial data, come join to learn more about this part of data science!</p>"
