title: 'Packaging for serverless: effortless? Doubtless!'
track:
abstract: "<p>A package-and-deploy pipeline is like plumbing: if it's working, you
  don't notice, but when it's not… you really do, and getting it working can be messy.
  We've tried several approaches for building Python artefacts to run on AWS Lambda,
  and finally settled on one that works well.  I'll walk through how the Pants build
  system works in practice for getting our code running in production, and how it's
  improved upon other common practices we previously used.</p>"
description: "<p>Across our system, we have dozens of serverless functions, most of
  which use PyPI dependencies. We previously used techniques like running <code>pip
  install --target=...</code> in a docker image, then copying in our source code:
  it mostly works, but… it sparks thumb-twiddling and pipeline-clogging more than
  it sparks joy.</p>\n<p>Using Pants, we build our artefacts quickly, reliably, cross-platform,
  and without boilerplate! Our builds are quick, through caching, parallelism, and
  avoiding emulation. Dependency inference means each only includes exactly what it
  needs, without maintaining careful lists. We even benefit from these more generally,
  like testing and building non-serverless artefacts too.</p>\n<p>Faster coding, faster
  builds, faster deploys, and faster cold-starts. It's like a working drain: Who doesn’t
  want that?</p>"
