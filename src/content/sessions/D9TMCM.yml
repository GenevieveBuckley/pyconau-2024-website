title: How to build a unit testing library from scratch?
abstract: "<p>Have you ever used Pytest? Have you ever wondered what happens when
  you run pytest over your tests folder, create parametrized test cases, or use fixtures?</p>\n
  <p>In this talk, we will find answers to all these by building our own testing library.\n
  By the end of this talk, you will have a solid understanding of reverse engineering
  and how internals of a testing library can be designed</p>"
