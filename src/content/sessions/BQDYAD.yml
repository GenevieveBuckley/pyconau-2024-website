abstract: "<p>Programming education increasingly centres around tools that offer automatic
  marking of student progress through a set of exercises. Automated marking has become
  increasingly popular as it allows instructors to provide personalised feedback to
  students in real-time and is easily scalable to large cohorts. It can also be used
  to provide instructors with detailed insight into the class progression.</p>\n<p>While
  this brings many new advantages it also creates new problems. Chief amongst those
  is the difficulty of marking long, dynamic and interactive programs which places
  a large burden on educators to develop sophisticated marking systems.</p>\n<p>At
  the more extreme end of the problem, we may be faced with students who want to take
  shortcuts such as hard-coding, or using Pythonâ€™s built-in functionality and third
  party packages, which may violate the spirit of the exercise. As a result these
  students may not be achieving learning outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will discuss
  and demonstrate practical approaches to the aforementioned problems that all educators
  can use to simplify marking and to increase their assurance of learning. We will
  also discuss current limitations that we face and provide recommendations to those
  wishing to apply these approaches.</p>"
