title: Fast, accurate, open-source geocoding in Python
abstract: "<p>Anytime you search for a cafe on Google Maps, you are using a geocoder:
  an algorithm that converts a text input into a standardized output, along with the
  precise geographic coordinates. Mapping points on a journey, linking large customer
  databases, even contact tracing all involve geocoding. Google’s Geocoding API is
  a common way to do this, however this can be costly and slow when there are a large
  number of locations. Furthermore, in sensitive domains such as healthcare, the use
  of an external API may not be permitted.</p>\n<p>So why don’t we make our own geocoder
  in Python instead?</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will introduce an open source Python
  package for geocoding. Aimed at anyone who tinkers with geospatial data, I will
  describe how it was built, along the way exploring a few different geocoding algorithms
  as well as tools such as embedded databases and text embeddings.</p>"
description: "<p>Address data is one of the most common (and messiest) forms of data.
  Typical problems that arise when working with addresses include: finding a restaurant;
  linking large customer databases; pinpointing the locations of businesses, events
  or places of interest; or mapping out a cycling trip. </p>\n<p>Answering these types
  of questions at scale requires geocoding algorithms, which convert an address to
  a standardized form along with a pair of coordinates; or reverse geocoding, that
  involves converting coordinates to an address. However, commercial tools such as
  Google’s Geocoding API may not provide a suitable solution due to cost and speed
  limitations or technical constraints when working with sensitive data.</p>\n<p>In
  this talk, I will introduce an open source Python package for geocoding and reverse
  geocoding.</p>\n<p>I will begin by presenting some typical use cases, before describing
  the challenges and some algorithmic approaches. Along the way we’ll delve into the
  wealth of publicly available, high quality location data, and learn about embedded
  databases and more elaborate techniques such as text embeddings, before presenting
  the final package. </p>\n<p>This talk is aimed at anyone with even a cursory interest
  in geospatial data, from beginners to geospatial analysts, or who just wants to
  get a better idea of how tools like Google’s geocoder work under the hood.</p>"
