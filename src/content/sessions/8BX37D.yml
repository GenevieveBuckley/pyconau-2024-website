track:
type: talk
abstract: <p>A whimsical introduction to making music and live coding beats with Python,
  during this talk we will use FoxDot, Supercollider and write Python code while exploring
  different techniques for coding beats. We will code up a beat in this talk and conclude
  with a live demonstration</p>
description: "<p>In this talk I will introduce beat-making using Foxdot: a Python-based
  language and editor for making music, We will start from scratch by creating basic
  sounds to get comfortable with the tool and proceed to explore a few different methods
  to make beats, At the end of the talk, we will have a beat in our hands that was
  live coded during the course of the talk!</p>\n<p>Timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(2 min)
