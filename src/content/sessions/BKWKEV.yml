abstract: "<p>Garbage in, garbage out. We all know that, but it's hard to know what
  to do about it. Documenting everything is well-intentioned, but it's often too detailed
  or too tedious to be effective. So what's the solution?</p>\n<p>Code.</p>\n<p>Using
  code to spell out the expectations between data producers and data teams can help
  to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the data is of the highest
  quality. This approach is ambitious, but it has the potential to change the way
  we collaborate and instil confidence in our data.</p>\n<p>I'll share my experiences
  with this approach, including the challenges and the wins. I hope you'll join me
  in exploring this new way of working with data.</p>"
