abstract: <p>MicroPython started life in early 2013 as an experiment, to see if it
  was possible to shrink a high-level language like Python down enough to run on very
  small devices.  Ten years later MicroPython is a mature open-source project that
  is relied upon by a wide variety of users.  In this talk I will discuss its history,
  my experiences maintaining it as an open source project, and some of the interesting
  places MicroPython has found itself in.</p>
description: <p>This talk will focus more on social aspects of software engineering
  rather than the technical bits, and doesn't require any background knowledge of
  MicroPython.  It will include some insights on how to run a big open-source project
  on GitHub, aspects of building and fostering a community, obtaining funding, testing,
  making releases and more.</p>
