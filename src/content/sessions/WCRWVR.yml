abstract: "<p>Australia’s electricity grid is transitioning to 100% renewable and
  the industry’s goal is to be able to run in this configuration by 2025.</p>\n<p>This
  is a huge engineering and organizational undertaking, and Python is supporting us
  all the way.</p>\n<p>This talk shall start with an overview of the energy grid as
  it has been pretty much for a century. We shall look at the physics of electricity
  and the control systems required to maintain constant, reliable supply.</p>\n<p>Management
  of the grid involving the movement of large volumes of data from sensors in the
  field, to centralized data stores. Data is merged with models and used to make operational
  decision in near real time, to design the grid into the future, and to analyse faults
  in the past.</p>\n<p>Python is used to support these data flows and models and executes
  in a high availability environment on servers, as well as on users’ desktops supporting
  ad hoc analysis.</p>\n<p>With every line of new code, Python becomes more critical
  to Australia’s energy future.</p>\n<p>We shall cover three broad topics:</p>\n<p>a)
  A little power system engineering: How the grid works.\nb) Case study: Modeling
  the grid in Python with code fragments.\nb) Case study: The weather (sunny? windy?
  hot? cold?) and social (weekend, weekday, public holiday) aspect of forecasting
  supply and demand.</p>"

  <p>Peter's bio is attached elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Josh's bio is below:</p>\n<p>Josh
  leads AEMO's Data Science team within Operational Forecasting, where they are responsible
  for the development and implementation of new machine learning (ML) models for operational
  grid demand and variable renewable energy (VRE) forecasting.</p>\n<p>Josh has a
  long history in numerical modelling and writing code, originally as an Engineer,
  and subsequently in a varied career comprising wind and solar farm design in Southern
  Africa, energy modelling for a large Australian energy retailer, and the past 7
  years working across various forecasting teams within AEMO, with a key focus on
  delivery of new modelling capabilities.</p>\n<p>Josh is passionate about the use
  and promotion of open-source software, starting years back attending events at the
  University of Cape Town Linux Enthusiasts Group (UCT LEG), and the Ubuntu ZA LoCo,
  and with interests ranging across Linux, sysadmin, robotics, and programming languages
  geared towards AI/ML such as Python and R.</p>"
