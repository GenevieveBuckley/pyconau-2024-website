title: How Python is supporting Australia’s energy transition to 100% renewable
abstract: "<p>Australia’s electricity grid is transitioning to 100% renewable and
  the industry’s goal is to be able to run in this configuration by 2025.</p>\n<p>This
  is a huge engineering and organizational undertaking, and Python is supporting us
  all the way.</p>\n<p>This talk shall start with an overview of the energy grid as
  it has been pretty much for a century. We shall look at the physics of electricity
  and the control systems required to maintain constant, reliable supply.</p>\n<p>Management
  of the grid involving the movement of large volumes of data from sensors in the
  field, to centralized data stores. Data is merged with models and used to make operational
  decision in near real time, to design the grid into the future, and to analyse faults
  in the past.</p>\n<p>Python is used to support these data flows and models and executes
  in a high availability environment on servers, as well as on users’ desktops supporting
  ad hoc analysis.</p>\n<p>With every line of new code, Python becomes more critical
  to Australia’s energy future.</p>"
