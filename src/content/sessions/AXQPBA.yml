title: A simple way to validate and monitor the performance of your ML Applications.
track: data
abstract: "<p>With all the hype about applications that uses machine learning, I think
  there is one key aspect that developers tend to forget: <strong>\"Performance check
  and monitoring\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>ML and AI services have become very accessible
  and can be integrated into any application you can think of. But what do you do
  after you integrated your ML models to your application? &lt;u&gt;How do you know
  that the output of the ML models are correct and up to standard? What are the signs
  that the model's performance is changing and how do you take action on such changes?
  &lt;/u&gt;</p>\n<p>Typically, these problems are just discussed on a theoretical
  and research level. But how can we carry over these techniques and apply it to our
  application? Not just that, how can we make it so that monitoring and performance
  check is as simple as writing a unit test (or not).</p>\n<p>In this session, we
  will learn some simple but effective ways on model performance monitoring as well
  as look at some python implementation and architecture consideration.</p>"
description: "<p>The inspiration for this talk came from a couple of months ago when
  my partner (software engineer) started looking into ChatGPT for her work. Almost
  every time, our conversation always ends with her asking &lt;u&gt;\"how do I know
  that the output of our application using chatgpt is correct?\"&lt;/u&gt;</p>\n<p>Model
  validation and performance checking is a very common topic on research and in the
  academe. However, due to the rise of AI as a service, more and more people started
  encountering this problem.</p>\n<p>Having implemented machine learning applications
  for more than 5 years, model validation can be quite cumbersome, especially when
  dealing with high traffic and variable type of datasets. But through the years,
  we've picked up some simple but practical approach to add these features in our
  python applications.</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on the following key ideas:</p>\n
  <ul>\n<li>Why do you need model validation?</li>\n<li>How do you choose the right
  validation metric for your ML application?</li>\n<li>Implementing a simple model
  validation module in python.</li>\n<li>Understanding the model validation result
  and how this affects your ML application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This session will require
  some basic understanding of machine learning but all the resource will be beginner
  friendly and code examples will be available for participants to try out in their
  free time.</p>"
