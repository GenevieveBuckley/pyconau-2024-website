abstract: "<p>What is PySpark? Can it solve all of my data problems? Are you sure
  I can’t just use pandas instead?</p>\n<p>This talk will aim to answer at least some
  of the questions you may have if you’re starting out with or looking to scale up
  your use of PySpark when working with data. This will be a mix of useful intro hints
  mixed with more technical backing, including a peek into what goes on behind the
  API and some common issues I’ve run into so that you can hopefully spend slightly
  less time getting frustrated by them.</p>\n<p>So whether you’re prepping for your
  next data engineering interview or are just curious about what might be going on
  in one small corner of the world of data, you’ll hopefully leave this talk feeling
  a bit more confident taking your next steps with big data.</p>"
