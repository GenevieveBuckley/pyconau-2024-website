title: Analysing and sharing genetic data with Python
track:
abstract: "<p>We give an overview of how Python is used in bioinformatics, focusing
  on high throughput DNA sequencing and clinical genetic variant detection and classification.</p>\n
  <p>We show our Django application, VariantGrid, developed by SA Health, which has
  also been used as a base for other projects, including the Australian Genomics project
  Shariant – the first platform used across Australia and New Zealand diagnostic labs
  for sharing variant classifications.</p>"
description: "<p>Python is one of the most popular languages used in Bioinformatics
  (a discipline that involves the intersection of biology and computing). Software
  has become critical to delivering modern healthcare to manage the enormous amounts
  of data. The latest DNA sequencers produce over a Terabyte of data per day.</p>\n
  <p>We give a brief overview of how DNA sequencing is performed clinically, and how
  Python fits into software processing (workflow systems like SnakeMake acting as
  a ‘glue’ for High Performance Computing, as well as quick prototyping language for
  custom research questions).</p>\n<p>We show a technical overview of VariantGrid
  - a Django application for storing, analysing and classifying genetic variants developed
  by SA Health that processes around 6000 patients a year.</p>\n<p>An analysis may
  involve multiple patients with a million variants each, and VariantGrid allows users
  to perform custom analyses by building variant filters via an interactive drag and
  drop node-graph interface. This is implemented as a Directed Acyclic Graph of Django
  Q objects, which are logically combined to generate a query.</p>\n<p>VariantGrid
  has been released as open and free for research use on GitHub: https://github.com/SACGF/variantgrid.</p>\n
  <p>The system is also used as a technology platform for other variant database projects
  such as RUNX1 - an international collaboration for a rare form of Leukemia, and
  Shariant - an Australian Genomics project for sharing variant knowledge between
  Australian and New Zealand diagnostic labs. Shariant has shared more than 23,000
  variant submissions from 13 labs to date (Tudini et al 2022, PMID: 36332611), enabling
  laboratories to provide faster and more accurate diagnoses and care for patients.</p>"
