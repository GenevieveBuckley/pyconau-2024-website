description: "<p>In 2019 I released Secateur, a tool designed to protect people from
  online harrassment on Twitter by giving a user the ability to block an attacker
  and <em>all</em> their followers for a set period of time. Now, in 2023 the new
  management of Twitter has decided such tools aren't desirable.</p>\n<p>This talk
  will serve as a retrospective on this little django side project that over the course
  of it's life grew to 70,000 users, made somewhere around four billion Twitter API
  calls, and was supported by several in the NZ/AU Python community.</p>\n<p>I might
  be able to throw in a few tales of weird accused-international espionage, too.</p>"
