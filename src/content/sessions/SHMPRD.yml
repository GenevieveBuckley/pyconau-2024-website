abstract: "<p>Python is a programming language known for its usefulness and ease of
  readability, making it an excellent choice for quickly creating services. These
  services can be scaled to millions of users. However, a myriad of problems comes
  hidden with it during the development phase if observability-driven development
  is not followed like the inability to meet the SLAs, poor performance, difficulty
  in tracking business metrics, etc and this can lead to anti-patterns in software.</p>\n
  <p>Metrics such as these can be valuable for root cause analysis, driving business
  goals, component-level monitoring, improving performance, and so on. In this presentation,
  I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and reliability
  when building a Python service from the ground up. I will explain the meaning of
  each concept, how to establish a culture that promotes these practices and provide
  a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how to implement these concepts effectively.</p>"
