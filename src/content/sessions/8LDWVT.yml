title: 'Practical Pipelines: A Houseplant Alerting System with ksqlDB'
abstract: "<p>300 Character Elevator Pitch\nBe a better plant parent and build a practical,
  event-driven pipeline with Raspberry Pi and Apache Kafka! Soil moisture readings
  are streamed into Kafka and transformed, driving real-time alerts. Learn how ksqlDB
  and Kafka Connect made this pipeline possible as we dive in and get our hands dirty!</p>"
description: "<p>Houseplants can be hard – in many cases, over- and under-watering
  can have the same symptoms. Take away the guesswork involved in caring for your
  houseplants while also gaining valuable experience in building a practical, event-driven
  pipeline in your own home! This talk explores the process of building a houseplant
  monitoring and alerting system using a Raspberry Pi and Apache Kafka. </p>\n<p>Moisture
  and temperature readings are captured from sensors in the soil and streamed into
  Kafka. From here, we’ll use stream processing to transform the data, create a summary
  view of the current state, and drive real-time push alerts through Telegram. In
  this session, I’ll talk about how I ingest the data followed by the tools – including
  ksqlDB and Kafka Connect – that help transform the raw data into useful information,
  and finally I’ll show how to use Kafka Producers and Consumers to make the entire
  application more interactive.</p>\n<p>By the end of the talk, you’ll have everything
  you need to start building practical streaming pipelines in your own home. Roll
  up your sleeves – let’s get our hands dirty!</p>"
