abstract: <p>Kids want to code games and I need them to learn the fundamental data
  structures and how to make a user interface. Pygame Zero seems like a gift - the
  UI power of pygame with a simpler format and an implied main loop. In truth there
  have been ups and downs in the journey implementing Pygame Zero into the Middle
  and Senior school classroom and I want to show you some of the promise and the pitfalls.</p>
description: "<p>I've just discovered that Pygame Zero is a thing. I have spent years
  fighting with Pygame and Kivy and to a lesser extent AppJar; Graphical User Interfaces
  are really hard. So when I found there was a clean, easy way to make games with
  Python using Pygame Zero I was ecstatic. I found it really easy to read and immediately
  implemented it into my classes. It didn't go exactly to plan. It turns out that
  there are two ways to learn stuff - one is to trust the teacher and learn by rote
  where the code should fit and the other is to break it down and synthesise it and
  understand where things should go. Turns out the latter is harder than I anticipated.
  \nI think that teachers and education fans will be interested to hear my story.
  They can see what my dream was and how it compares with the reality. \nI have hope
  that Pygame Zero is going to serve a purpose as a stepping stone between text based
  Python and stuff that involves User Interface and I have ideas about how to do things
  better but maybe I can help others to avoid some of the problems I faced on the
  way.</p>"
