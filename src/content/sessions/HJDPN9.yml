title: All the things I learnt as a junior developer (so you don't have to)
abstract: "<p>Being a junior developer is scary. But what should you do to make sure
  your junior developer journey is productive? My talk will give you some career advice
  that you can take, or pass to your juniors - through the lens of all the lessons
  and mistakes I've done.</p>\n<p>(At least it'll be better than Googling the answer.)</p>"
description: "<p>Regardless from where you start - either as a newly-minted graduate
  from a university, a person who finished as a bootcamp course, or self-taught -
  starting out in this industry can be complex, confusing, and scary.</p>\n<p>However,
  many juniors encounter the same set of common issues and pitfalls: how to level
  up in this industry, how not to burn yourself out, and what should they be looking
  for at a company. This talk will answer some of those common answers through all
  the lessons, mistakes and regrets I made during my time as a junior developer.</p>\n
  <p>This talk is for those who are starting out, knows someone who is starting out
  and don't have all the answers, or just want to learn from someone's misadventures
  in the tech industry.</p>"
