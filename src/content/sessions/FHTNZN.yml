abstract: <p>This talk explores Robyn, a Python web framework that utilizes Rust to
  achieve high performance while still allowing for easy Python code writing. By examining
  Robyn's architecture and development, the speaker will discuss how it improves web
  application performance and provides insights into designing high-performance web
  frameworks. The talk highlights the growing involvement of Rust in the Python ecosystem
  and how Robyn is pushing the limits of Python web development.</p>
description: "<p>With the rise of Rust bindings being used in the Python ecosystem,
  we know that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the Python
  ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web
  ecosystem and the increase of performance by using Rust as a core, Robyn was created.
  </p>\n<p>Robyn is one of the fastest Python web frameworks in the current Python
  web ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn achieves near-native rust performance
  while still having the ease of writing Python code. </p>\n<p>This talk will focus
  on the increased involvement of Rust in the Python ecosystem. It will also demonstrate
  why Robyn was created, the technical decisions behind Robyn, the increased performance
  by using the Rust runtime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly,
  how the community is helping Robyn grow!</p>\n<p>I will briefly demonstrate my experience
  and challenges of building a community around the project and how it allowed Robyn
  to ensure a smooth sail even in turbulent situations. I shall also share my future
  plans for Robyn.</p>"
