title: Choosing Wisely - How to Pick the Right Third Party Packages for your Project
track: djangocon
abstract: <p>Python has an incredible library of open source packages you can use
  in your own project, but how do you pick the right one? What can happen if you pick
  the <em>wrong</em> one? In this talk, we'll discuss the process of choosing the
  right dependencies - from architecture to security to licensing. By the end you'll
  have a good understanding of what to look for in a package and what to avoid.</p>
description: "<p>Building a modern Python application can sometimes feel a little
  like building out of Lego bricks, with third party packages ready to solve almost
  any problem just a <code>pip install</code> away. At last count, PyPI had over 450,000
  packages to choose from, and the right ones will save you time and let you focus
  on the problems you really care about.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, picking the right
  packages isn't always as simple as googling \"Django multi factor auth\" and pip
  installing the first result. There are some very serious factors to consider when
  choosing a package, and this talk will take you through the most important ones.</p>\n\
  <p>We'll cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the risks of installing the
  wrong package?</li>\n<li>How do we know when a third party package is the right
  solution?</li>\n<li>How can we evaluate the quality of a package, especially when
  the contents may be way above our own skill level?</li>\n<li>How are packages licensed
  and why should we care?</li>\n<li>How can we manage the ongoing risks of having
  third party code in our projects?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will be an important foundational
  talk for anyone building Python applications in a personal or commercial setting.\
  \  Third party libraries are one of the most common ways attackers compromise applications,
  and all developers should have a good understanding of the strategies professional
  developers use to manage this risk while getting the most out of Python's amazing
  ecosystem.</p>"
