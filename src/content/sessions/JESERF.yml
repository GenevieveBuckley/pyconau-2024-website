abstract: <p>Learn how one can write efficient APIs in Python with high-quality API
  specifications using Open API and RAML specs to create API contracts and achieve
  a better experience using the API with more reliable unit tests and increased response
  consistency, thereby master the art of building robust and scalable APIs.</p>
description: <p>API is at the core of almost every project, and developers need to
  know how to build these RESTful APIs which serves multiple channels including microservices,
  mobile, web et al. Writing an efficient API provides the developers with a cleaner
  structure, deprecation policies, better unit test coverage, and a great documentation
  workflow. Learn how one can write efficient APIs with high-quality API specifications
  using Open API and RAML specs to create API contracts and achieve a better experience
  using the API with more reliable unit tests and increased response consistency.
  The audience will understand the architectural constraints which make any web service
  a perfect RESTful API, Contract-first vs Code-first approach, HTTP concepts along
  the best practices needed to build an elegant API.</p>
