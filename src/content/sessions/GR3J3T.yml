abstract: "<p>If you need to build a user interface for your Python code, most guides
  will tell you that your only options are to use the command line, or wrap your code
  in a web interface. </p>\n<p>However, there is another option - building a GUI interface.
  In this talk, you'll learn how to build a cross-platform GUI application to wrap
  your Python code.</p>"
description: <p>No matter the language it's written in, code is only useful if a user
  can interact with it. In this talk, you'll learn about the options that exist for
  building cross-platform GUI interfaces with Python. You'll learn about the unique
  problems that face developers of GUI applications, and how to address those problems.
  You'll also get an introduction to <strong>Toga</strong>, the cross-platform GUI
  toolkit that is part of the BeeWare Project, and to Briefcase, which can be used
  to deploy apps to macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web.</p>
