abstract: <p>In addition to its role as the scripting language of choice in the 3D
  graphics world, Blender one of the leading 3D art programs is built with Python
  and is packed full of ways you can use Python code to create 3D content both directly
  and through plugins that sometimes even have their own Python APIs. Come with me
  on a short journey into how you can create 3D content using Blender, its plugins,
  and Python!</p>
description: <p>Blender is, in their own words "the free and open source 3D creation
  suite" and "It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modelling, rigging, animation,
  simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation
  pipeline." Python has been an integral part of Blender for over 20 years, and much
  of the Blender ecosystem is built from Python plugins and Python scripts, some of
  which have even developed their own Python APIs for other people to use and extend.
  I'll be focusing on the very basics of using Blender, just enough about the how
  to use it so you can move around and get started with using Python and plugins which
  can be extended by adding your own Python code to them like Sverchok and Sorcar
  to start making things in no time at all and how adding some Python code you can
  take the basics even further and really unleash your creativity.</p>
