abstract: <p>Tech debt is a familiar concept in most organisations and has been the
  subject of extensive discussion regarding individual &amp; organisational factors.
  However, what’s missing is a macro-economic analysis of why tech debt exists and
  how to combat it. This talk provides that analysis.</p>
description: '<p>Technical debt is a much-bemoaned aspect of nearly every engineer’s
  life. How and to what extent to eliminate it has been the subject of much discussion.
  Is tech debt the result of individual engineers cutting corners? Are the engineers
  who write this code just incompetent? Are there organisational factors that contribute?
  If so, what are they? All of these are worthy of discussion, however, there is another
  factor conspicuously missing from this discussion: macroeconomics, the dismal science.
  Macroeconomic factors dictate organisational behaviour and have a cascading effect
  on teams and individuals within organisations. In this talk, I discuss technical
  debt in the context of the work of institutional economist Hyman Minsky, contextualising
  tech debt as a form of operating debt organisations take on. Minsky’s theory on
  this topic provides a compelling analysis of organisations’ borrowing behaviour,
  and by extension, how tech debt works.</p>'
