abstract: <p>Why does AI perceive gender? Is this something that can be fixed? Should
  it be fixed? Explore the results of my research encompassing art, AI and gender
  theory to find out the why and how of gender perception.</p>
description: <p>My PhD subject was AI perceptions of gender. I will take you through
  my key findings, my artwork projects created to explore this topic and how that
  research has progressed today in the days of generative AI. I will explore perception
  theory, gender theory and art all using AI to show why gender is fundamentally misunderstood
  by machine learning systems and ask the question why are we still letting machines
  assign gender to us?</p>
