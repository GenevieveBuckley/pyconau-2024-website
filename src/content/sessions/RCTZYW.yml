description: "<p>Are you happy with every aspect of how you develop software?\n- Is
  it clear what you should be doing?\n- Do you understand why your job needs to be
  done?\n- Are your team mates a delight to work with?\n- Are you getting the best
  use out of your tools?\n- What could (or should) you be doing differently?\n- Does
  everyone you work with have the same answer to these questions?</p>\n<p>All these
  questions, and more, can be answered in a retrospective: a structured discussion
  about how you go about your work and what you could do to improve.</p>\n<p>In this
  talk I'll discuss:\n- What a retrospective is\n- How I run a good retrospective\n
  - Digital tools for when you can't gather in person</p>"
