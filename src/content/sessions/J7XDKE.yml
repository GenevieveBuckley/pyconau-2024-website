title: What can't WebAssembly do?
abstract: <p>You might know of WebAssembly as a way to run languages other than JavaScript
  in a web app, but it is much more than that. Not only does WebAssembly let us push
  the limits of what a web browser can do, it also has an exciting future outside
  the browser.</p>
description: "<p>To really understand WebAssembly, we need to look at what it means
  to compile code for different CPUs and operating systems. We'll use the CPython
  interpreter as an example to show how compiling for an M1 Mac is different to an
  Intel CPU or a Windows machine. From there we can look deeper into how WebAssembly
  works, and we'll explore both options (WASI and Emscripten) for running Python in
  WebAssembly and why they're both really cool in different ways.</p>\n<p>There's
  a whole world of possibilities that WebAssembly lets us explore! We will push the
  limits of what you can do in a browser to an entirely unnecessary level, and explore
  how WebAssembly is shaping up to impact the future of cross-platform support and
  cloud computing too!</p>"
