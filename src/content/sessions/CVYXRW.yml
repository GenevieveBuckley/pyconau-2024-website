abstract: <p>Everyone wants to understand why things happen, and what would happen
  if you did things differently. You’ve probably read that statistics can only tell
  you if things are correlated, or associated, and this explains nothing about cause
  and effect. But in fact there’s a process called Causal Inference which does answer
  these questions, can tell you if A causes B and more importantly, can tell you what
  would happen, if… This talk will help you to frame and tackle these questions using
  your data and some popular Python libraries.</p>
description: "<p>Causal inference is used by statisticians, econometricians, and data
  scientists to understand cause-and-effect relationships. It seeks to determine the
  causal impact of a particular treatment or intervention on an outcome of interest,
  while accounting for potential confounding factors in a principled and accurate
  way. Causal Inference is often used with historical, observational data, or where
  it’s unethical, too expensive, or impractical to conduct a randomized controlled
  trial (RCT). </p>\n<p>Causal inference methods often rely on statistical Machine
  Learning models and techniques to estimate causal effects. Using these models, hypothetical
  or counterfactual scenarios can be explored - what would have happened, under different
  conditions. The models also provide insight into why things happened - and which
  factors were most responsible. \nPython is one of the most popular languages for
  Causal Inference. PyWhy is a collection of Open-Source libraries for Causal Inference,
  including DoWhy and EconML. This talk will explore how to use these tools with your
  existing data to form and answer Causal questions, and some tips and tricks to help
  you interpret and validate your results. The content will be aimed at people with
  basic Python coding experience and doesn’t require any advanced maths.</p>"
