## Childcare

PyCon AU will be providing onsite childcare at a very discounted rate. This is for all children up to around 12 years old, and covers the duration of talks on the schedule.

The child care will be held on-site in a dedicated space.

Weâ€™re offering this service a heavily discounted rate. If that cost is problematic for you let us know and we can work something out.

To register for child care please purchase a child care ticket for each child.

Childcare registrations will close in advance of the conference in order to ensure we provide enough professional carers for the number and ages of the children.
