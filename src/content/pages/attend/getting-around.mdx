# Getting to and around PyCon AU

## When to get there

Registration will open at **8am** each day of the conference. You'll need to collect your badge from the registration desk before you'll be able to attend talks, so make sure you're there bright and early on the first day of the conference!

Talks start at 9am on each day, and end between 5pm and 5:30pm depending on the day. [See the program](/program/) for exact details.

## How to get there

PyCon AU is being held in the **East Wing of the Adelaide Convention Centre**. Enter via the **Main Entrance**, which is located on North Terrace between the Riverside office building and the main convention centre building.
