# COVID-19 information

PyCon AU 2023 is a primarily in-person event being held in a period where COVID-19 is still in the community. We can’t totally eliminate the risk this presents, but below are the measures we’re taking, which you can use to decide if attending PyCon AU in person meets your risk tolerance.

We all have a responsibility to keep each other safe, including the people in our community who are at higher risk than us. The PyCon AU 2023 organisers take the risk of COVID-19 seriously, and expect all attendees to do the same.

We will have more to announce about our COVID-19 policy soon. For now, take a look at the [2023 COVID-19 policy](https://2023.pycon.org.au/safety/covid/); this year's is likely to be similar.
