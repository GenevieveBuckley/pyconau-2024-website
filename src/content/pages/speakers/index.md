# Speaker pack

This page contains information for all speakers. _Please make sure you read both this and the [in-person](/speakers/in-person/) or [remote](/speakers/remote/) section as appropriate._

## Talk duration and questions

All talks run for **half an hour (30 minutes), including questions**.

It is your choice whether to allow time for questions inside your time slot. Often, speakers who choose to take questions will allow 5 minutes for questions.

However, you can decide how you would like to handle questions about your talk. By default, Session Chairs will assume you are not taking questions. Please tell your Session Chair what your preferences are.

You have two choices for taking questions for your talk:

- **No questions (default)**: you can use the whole 30 minutes for your talk. If people have questions they can find you afterwards.
- **Curated questions**: your Session Chair will stand next to the microphone and moderate questions (e.g. by stepping in if someone makes a comment instead of asking a question), including passing the microphone to audience members.

Your Session Chair will sit in the front row and give you time warning cards at 5, 2, and 1 minutes remaining, and STOP when you have hit your time (e.g. at 25 minutes if you want 5 minutes for questions). Please speak with your Session Chair before your talk about any preferences you have.

There are 10 minutes between talks for changeover. Please respect this time limit. Once your slot is over, please collect your things and continue any conversations in the hallway, in order to give the next speaker an equal chance to prepare.

## Slide tips

Here are some suggestions for slide design that will help you avoid a few common disappointing situations that presenters can face. (We thank previous PyCon AU organisers for this helpful list).

- Ensure that text isn’t too close to the borders or sides of your slides

  - Projectors have a tendency to cut the sides of your slides!
    - Avoid highly indented bullet points
      - It’s a sign you’re overloading the slide.
        - With too much information.
          - Which can get frustrating

- Ensure that text is large enough to be readable at a distance (> 18 point is usually a good guide). If you can read your slide in the thumbnail preview, that is a good sign.
- Projectors - compared to screens - often have **very poor** contrast. Just because it looks good on your computer screen doesn't mean it will look good on the projector. Avoid too many fancy colours - just keep it simple.
- Use high contrast colour schemes. White on black is good, blue on white is good, pink on purple is terrible.
- Many people have problems with seeing low contrast colours and images. Please also try to consider colour-blind people when picking colours.
- Spellcheck your presentation.

More helpful hints can be found in the Writing Slides section of [VM Brasseur’s Public Speaking Resources](https://github.com/vmbrasseur/Public_Speaking#writing-presentations).

## Conduct and expectations

Please ensure your talk content and slides comply with our [code of conduct](/safety/). This includes your own behaviour as well as anything you endorse or encourage.

In particular:

- Don't include content where you attack or pentest conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or conference attendees, in any way.
- If you are talking about past hacks or social engineering, you must have had informed consent for any system or person affected, and you must clearly indicate that this was the case.
- If you're not sure whether something you want to present complies with the code of conduct, or you want more information, contact [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

Any actions that make attendees feel unwelcome or unsafe fall under the Code of Conduct. There's more information here: https://2023.pycon.org.au/safety/.

## Content warnings

If your talk contains content that you think might be sensitive, distressing or traumatic to some people (even if most people will be fine with it) please add a content warning, which you can do by [editing your accepted talk proposal in Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/).

Content warnings aren't a moral judgement on your talk, and they won't restrict who is able to watch it. In fact, the opposite is true—for some of your audience members, if they know something they find distressing is coming up, they'll be better able to handle it than if it's a surprise. That lets them look after their mental health and better engage with and learn from your talk!

Some examples of content warnings:

> This talk contains extensive discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout.

> This talk contains images and brief mentions of bushfires and other natural disasters.

**Content warnings don't exempt you from the code of conduct.** Instead, content warnings are used for things that comply with the code of conduct, but might be distressing to some people.

## Talk recording

Your talk will be recorded, unless you have opted out of the recording release in your talk proposal form. All recorded talks will be available on the PyCon AU YouTube channel shortly after the event: https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU.

The talks will also be uploaded to the Linux Australia mirror, at https://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/

We will publish these talks under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.

## Your published talk details

Your talk information and biography is [up on our website](/program/).

Please take the time to look over your talk entry, and make sure that you are happy with your abstract and biography.

Should you wish to update your biography, profile photo, or abstract, [you can edit them in Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/). Note that the website may take up to an hour to update. If you aren't able to do so, contact [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

We advise you to send through any changes as soon as possible, ahead of the event, as the organising team will be very busy during the event and will not have time to push website changes outside of egregious errors or emergencies.

## What to do if something comes up

Sometimes things happen!

Laptops run out of power, slides go missing, transport runs late, family stuff comes up, physical or mental health problems can occur. If anything comes up at any point, please let Maia and Yaakov (our Program Chairs) or one of the other conference organisers know. We have an experienced organising team who can help with a broad range of questions, issues, or concerns. The sooner you let us know if there is a problem, the sooner we can work with you to achieve the best possible outcome.

If you’re just unsure and need to clarify something, use the Attendee Discord (details to come) or email [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au).

If you are having an urgent problem relating to conference logistics, please contact us. A 24-hour hotline number will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues can be directed to a Volunteer, A/V Team member, or Organiser, as appropriate.

If you have an issue that should involve our Conduct Team, you can contact a member of the safety team via a 24-hour hotline number will be made available at the event. Less immediate issues of Conduct can be emailed to safety@pycon.org.au. Signs with these details will be around the venue.

If you have an immediate safety concern, please contact venue security, or Emergency Services (000). If you do call Emergency Services remember to let venue security know as well.
