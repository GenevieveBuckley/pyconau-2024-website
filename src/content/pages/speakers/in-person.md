# In-person presentations

This page contains additional information for in-person presentations. _Please make sure you've also read [the main Speaker Pack page](/speakers/)._

## What should I wear?

PyCon AU has no formal dress code, with the exception that you can’t wear things that violate our Code of Conduct.

Some speakers choose to wear something casual that they feel comfortable in, others choose to wear something formal, yet others choose to wear something attention-grabbing and vivid that expresses who they are. All of those choices are valid and encouraged!

However, we use lavalier (or lapel) microphones, which are small clip-on microphones that are attached to a “beltpack” (which contains a battery and transmitter) via a cable. Because of this:

- You need somewhere to put the “beltpack”, like a belt or a pocket. **This is particularly important if you’re wearing a dress or skirt, or some other outfit that might not have pockets.**
- You need somewhere on your chest that you can clip the microphone to. (T-shirts are usually fine, as is the collar or lapel of most other garments.)
- You need to be able to put on and take off the microphone comfortably in public. (We can route the cable over or under clothing, and you can put the microphone on yourself with our AV team’s guidance, but we don’t have dressing rooms for you to “mic up” in.)

## Display resolution

We use a 16:9 ratio on all displays with 1080p resolution (1920 x 1080).

## Video connections

You will present from your own laptop; we do not collect slides to load onto a lectern computer (if this is not possible, let us know in advance). You will have a confidence monitor but it will display what is on the projector, not your speaker notes (if you have them, they will display on your laptop screen).

All rooms will **only** have HDMI connectors. If you need an adapter to output HDMI, **please bring it with you (especially if you are a Mac user and/or need USB-C connectors)**. We strongly recommend you bring the power adapter for your device, too.

There will also be an audio connector (3.5mm headphone/mini-jack). If you are intending on playing audio, please let the A/V team know when setting up for your talk so they can test sound levels before you start.

If you have special requirements beyond this, please get in touch in advance with Ryan, the AV team lead, on [ryan@nextdayvideo.com.au](mailto:ryan@nextdayvideo.com.au).

## Testing your laptop

**It is recommended that you test your laptop before your talk.** A test setup will be available in the AV room, which is Skyway Room 2. This will be similar to the podium setup, allowing you to plug your laptop in and check that it works for video and audio. You can find this room on the mezzanine level between Hall C and Halls A/B, or marked on the venue map, which will be on the event website closer to the event. A helpful volunteer can direct you if you become lost.

## Arrive early

Please make sure you know when and where your talk is scheduled. Please check the [schedule](/program/) to confirm the day, time, and room for which your talk is scheduled.

We will not be making any more schedule changes unless absolutely necessary. If any changes affect you, we will let you know as soon as possible. Again, if you have concerns or need to change something, please contact us at [program@pycon.org.au](mailto:program@pycon.org.au) as soon as possible.

**It is essential that you arrive in your talk room in the break before your talk** to ‘check in’ with and meet your Session Chair and A/V team. This will give you time to look at the layout of your room, assess the space, etc.

## Quiet space

Should you need a quiet place to prepare for the talk, meditate, or unwind, we have a room set aside for this purpose. You can find the Quiet Room, Skyway Room 3, marked on our venue map which will be available on the event website closer to the event. Please note that this room is shared with all other conference attendees who may need it, so it is **not** a good place to rehearse your talk.
