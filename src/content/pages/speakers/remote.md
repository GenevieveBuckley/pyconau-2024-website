# Remote presentations

This page contains additional information for remote presentations. _Please make sure you've also read [the main Speaker Pack page](/speakers/)._

## Updating your talk information

If you need to update your talk information, you can [edit your accepted submission on Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/).

If you haven't already, we need you to tick the consent box that says we're allowed to stream your content, otherwise we can't! You can make changes to your title, abstract, bio, and so on.

## Tech check & technology

Every remote presenter will require a tech check 2-4 weeks before the event (and if you are pre-recording, before you pre-record).

Tech Checks take about 10 minutes and even presenters who have been presenting at lots of online conferences find them very valuable, and doing a dry test run helps avoid delays and problems on the day.

To book a tech check, see the Next Day Video Presenter Portal (see below).

To present, you only require a Chromium-based browser (i.e. Google Chrome), a webcam, and a microphone. You will be able to share your screen and we will receive your webcam and your shared screen. We strongly encourage a second screen so you can present from one, and stay in touch with us from another.

## Next Day Video presenter portal

If you are a remote presenter, you will be emailed a link to the Next Day Video Presenter Portal. In here you can do the following:

- Select whether you are pre-recording or live streaming
  - If you are pre-recording, upload a video
- Book a Tech Check.
- Verify that your details are correct. If they are not, please update them in Pretalx or contact the organisers.

If you do not have a link to the portal, please let the organisers know as soon as possible, as it may be assumed you are presenting in-person.

## Preparing & submission deadlines

We encourage you to live stream, as we can help optimise how your stream sounds and looks.

If you are pre-recording, you must submit your talk 2 weeks before the conference starts (Thursday 3rd August 2023). If we do not receive a video, or the video does not meet required audio or video quality levels, you will default back to a live stream.

Please note even with a pre-recorded presentation, we would like remote presenters to still join us through the streaming platform to do an introduction and thank-you (so the procedure below still applies). If this isn’t possible due to timezones or other challenges, please let us know.

## Tech tips

The biggest request is:

- Use an external wired microphone such as a USB headset or other external mic (i.e. Logitech headset or a Rode NT-USB Mini).
- Use a wired headset or earbuds (where your computer plays audio).
- Please avoid using bluetooth microphones e.g. AirPods.

This is because we may communicate back to you during your presentation if there is an issue; speaking into a laptop mic without a headset does not work very well.

If pre-recording, please make sure your audio is clear and levels are high with minimal background noise and echo. We will QA every video, and we encourage a Tech Check to minimise issues.

Ensure your video is not longer than your allocated talk time.

## On the day procedure

### 60 minutes before your talk (T-60)

Please check into the Backstage in the Next Day Video Portal and let us know you’re there. An AV technician will jump on the streaming system with you and run a test.

### 10 minutes before your talk (T-10)

Please jump back into the Backstage, so we can get you live. Please be on time as there are a lot of moving parts in person to coordinate.

You will have a dedicated AV technician with you the entire time to talk you through the process, and they will let you know when you’ll be live, and when you have finished & off-air.
