DjangoGirls is a free, full day workshop helping you to build your first application using HTML, CSS, Python and Django. People progress through the workshop with the help of a team of mentors.

During the workshop, attendees follow a tutorial written especially for this purpose. The tutorial is also open sourced and available for free. It covers creating your blog application from scratch, including deployment to Python Anywhere.

Beginners are welcome. We welcome applications from anyone with a marginalised experience of gender. This includes all people who identify as women and non-binary.

Please bring a laptop or contact us at adelaide@djangogirls.org if you do not have access to one.
