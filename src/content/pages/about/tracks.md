# Specialist Tracks

This year we have four specialist tracks, in addition to the main conference! Specialist tracks are independently run events held on the first day of PyCon AU.

## DjangoCon AU

After a short break, the ninth DjangoCon AU is running in 2023!

We welcome talks about Django from all experience levels, but as a conference for Django enthusiasts, we also want to hear from those outside Django.

A tradition for DjangoCons has been to invite speakers from other web frameworks and programming languages to share their experience, to help Djangonauts learn and pick up ideas from outside the Django ecosystem. We would like to extend that offer to all our submitters!

Even if the framework in focus of your talk is not Django, or even based in Python, we welcome your submission! Just note that our audience is strongly Django/Python inclined, and may not know a lot about your framework/language.

## Education

Learn about learning, teach about teaching, and educate about education!

The Education Track brings together teachers, programmers, educators, creators of education tools, students and folks who are keen to learn and discuss ideas to help the next generation of programmers. Python programming is becoming more common in education settings, whether taught as part of the Digital Technologies classrooms, integrated across the curriculum, or embedded in coding clubs. We want to hear from teachers, education professionals, edutech enthusiasts and more about what's worked, what hasn't and everything in-between!

The PyConAU Education Track for 2023 will also have a dedicated Student Showcase for student presentations. We are calling for proposals for short talks from Australian high school students who are using Python in a project, class assignment or who are hacking on something cool. All levels of experience are welcome from complete novices to Python pros. Applications for the Student Showcase will open soon, through a separate process.

## Our Connected Universe

Every day, billions and billions of bytes fly around between systems sharing data, and as technologists it’s our job to build and manage these systems. “Our Connected Universe” is a track dedicated to the exploration and celebration of how data drives our world, and the APIs and architectures that make it all possible.

## All Things Data!

The data specialist track is all about how we use Python to gain insights from data, as well as the human side of data and its management. This track encompasses topics including data analysis, statistics, machine learning, data engineering, pipeline orchestration, scientific programming, storytelling and visualisation, Whether you work in a large team or a small one, in industry or academia, if you’re processing and understanding data then there’s a plethora of Python based tools available to you. Alongside the shiny tools and techniques, we will also focus on the importance of data management, team collaboration, and the societal impacts that data can have.
