# PyCon Fair

Sometimes, there’s something you want to share with the community, but a conference talk isn’t the best format to share it. That’s why this year, we’re trialling a small preview of a new format: PyCon Fair.

Each of our selected stalls will be provided with an A0-size poster on a pinboard, and a trestle table; the rest is up to their imagination.

PyCon Fair is pretty small this year; our hope is that it inspires you to come up with something cool to make it even bigger in future years! This year, we have two stalls that have been submitted as part of the Call for Proposals, plus an additional number of stalls that attendees can apply to be a part of during the conference.

## What can I submit?

Show off some cool robotics demos, some interesting visualisations, or even better, something we haven’t thought of! The only limitations on what you can do are:

- You must follow our [Code of Conduct](/conduct)
- You can’t do anything that’s restricted by our venue, like serve food or set off pyrotechnics, without asking us first (if you’re not sure, ask)
- You can’t use your space to promote a commercial product or recruit potential employees. If you’d like to promote a product or recruit, [take a look at our sponsor packages](/sponsor), which offer booths that allow you to have a presence for the entire duration of the conference.

## How can I submit?

We'll give you details on how to submit your PyCon Fair stall during the opening session.

Note that submissions received during the conference won't be provided with an A0 poster, but there will be a pinboard for you if you want to print and bring your own.

If you need power (Australian standard - 240V AC), please let us know in your submission.

## How will the Fair run?

PyCon Fair will run from 1:30pm-3:20pm on the Sunday afternoon, in room E2. Please be there 15 minutes beforehand to set up your stall. You will also have some additional time afterwards to pack up your stall.

What you do with your stall in that time is largely up to you (see above).
