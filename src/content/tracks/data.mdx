The data specialist track is all about how we use Python to gain insights from data, as well as the human side of data and its management. This track encompasses topics including data analysis, statistics, machine learning, data engineering, pipeline orchestration, scientific programming, storytelling and visualisation, Whether you work in a large team or a small one, in industry or academia, if you’re processing and understanding data then there’s a plethora of Python based tools available to you. Alongside the shiny tools and techniques, we will also focus on the importance of data management, team collaboration, and the societal impacts that data can have.
