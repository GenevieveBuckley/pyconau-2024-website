Saturday and Sunday are the main conference event of PyCon AU. We invite speakers from all backgrounds and levels of knowledge to share their experience and knowledge with our audience.

## 21–22 Aug: Development sprints and social events

Development Sprints provide an unstructured location for projects and contributors to work in real time on their projects, or for people to hack about with various things with people with experts in their fields.

## About PyCon AU

PyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.

PyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.

PyCon AU is typically held in two year blocks at the same city, with some variation in 2020–2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
