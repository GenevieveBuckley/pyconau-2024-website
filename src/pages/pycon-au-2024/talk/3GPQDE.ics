DESCRIPTION:There are around 6\,200 primary schools around Australia\, and 
 the curriculum has a requirement to teach Digital Technologies\, which inc
 ludes a coding portion.  There are many challenges here\, not least which 
 is enabling the approximately 150\,000 primary school teachers with the sk
 ills and resources to teach programming to young students.  The AustSTEM f
 oundation was set up to assist in this area\, and developed a MicroPython 
 based learning platform\, which consists of a pocket-sized computing devic
 e that integrates with a web-based coding and teaching environment.  The t
 eaching material has many hands-on activities\, with connections to nature
  and science.  In this talk we will discuss this teaching platform\, how i
 t can help students transition from block-based programming to textual cod
 ing\, and show some of the successes we have had so far in Australian clas
 srooms.
