        <meta name="description" content="Statistics do not come intuitively to humans; they always try to find simple ways to describe complex things. Given a complex dataset, they may feel tempted to use simple summary statistics like the mean, median, or standard deviation to describe it. However, these numbers are not a replacement for visualizing the distribution.

To illustrate this fact, researchers have generated many datasets that are very different visually, but share the same summary statistics. In this talk, I will discuss *Data Morph*, an open source package that builds on previous research using simulated annealing to perturb an arbitrary input dataset into a variety of shapes, while preserving the mean, standard deviation, and correlation to multiple decimal points. I will showcase how it works, discuss the challenges faced during development, and explore the limitations of this approach.">

                    <p>This talk introduces <em>Data Morph</em>, a new open source Python package I built that can be used to morph an input dataset of 2D points into select shapes, while preserving the summary statistics to a given number of decimal points through simulated annealing. <em>Data Morph</em> extends research from Autodesk to create the <a href="https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/research/publications-assets/pdf/same-stats-different-graphs.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Datasaurus Dozen</a>, and is intended to be used as a teaching tool for illustrating why you can’t rely solely on summary statistics. Come learn how it works and what it took to translate the research into an open-source library.</p>
