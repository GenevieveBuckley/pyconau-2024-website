                <section class="description">
                    <p>This talk is suitable for Python beginners and the set of Python scripts to automate assignment marking was developed in 2020 when I was teaching at the Hong Kong Baptist University. Each student was marked using standard assessment rubrics stored in an Excel spreadsheet. All the marks of a class of students are then stored in a folder of Excel files. I will demonstrate the automation of the following actions using Python libraries related to Excel such as openpyxl and xlwings.</p>
<p>-Create individual student mark sheets with names and other details filled in<br>
-Check marking mistakes such as missing marks or giving marks above the highest score<br>
-Adjustment of marks in all mark sheets due to errors made in assignment design, etc.<br>
-Collect marks from each individual Excel mark sheet<br>
-Export Excel mark sheets to PDF format for archive purposes</p>
<p>I will also compare the benefits of automating Excel using Python with Excel formulae and Visual Basic for Application by separating programming logic from data. Especially in the light of the Government Cybersecurity initiative "Essential Eight Maturity Model", Visual Basic for Application should be avoided and Python can be a viable solution.</p>
