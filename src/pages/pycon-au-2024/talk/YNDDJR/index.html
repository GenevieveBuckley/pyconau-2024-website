                <section class="description">
                    <p>I've always been interested in zoology – my dad has a degree in zoology – and over the past year or two, I've started learning more about phylogeny. Phylogeny is the study of the evolution of species, seeking to understand their common ancestors, when and how they branched, and how closely related various species are.</p>
<p>A common tool in phylogeny is the cladogram, a "tree of life" showing the different relationships between species. Cladograms are a great tool for understanding a family of organisms. However, when I started wanting to explore cladograms myself, I couldn't find anything that had all the features I wanted. This led me to start building it myself, and as I did so, I started thinking that maybe it was something that scientists and educators might find useful.</p>
<p>And so I dove into the problem with gusto, and built a cladogram tool that could do it all, and is nice and user friendly, and great for students of all ages. In this talk I'll explain what I wanted it to do, the saga of trying to work out if it already existed, and how I built the tool. I'll also show you where you can access it to try out yourself and maybe learn something interesting about your favourite animal!</p>
