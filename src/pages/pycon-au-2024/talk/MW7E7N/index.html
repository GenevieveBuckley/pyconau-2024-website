        <meta name="description" content="Making an open source package is pretty hard in 2024. Expectations are high, and there’s a lot to take into account. I recently developed an open source package. This talk covers what worked, what didn’t work, what I would do again and what I would do differently.

I developed an open source package called “scores” ( https://github.com/nci/scores , https://scores.readthedocs.io/ ).  This is not a presentation about what “scores” does, but instead covers the lessons I learned. Despite being an experienced software developer and having used lots of open source software, there was still a lot to learn (and a lot to figure out) about open source package maintenance.

Every package is different, but this is what I did and these are the lessons I learned. 

- Technical Matters:
    - How to lay things out on disk
    - Configuration files
    - Automated testing
    - Type hinting
    - Linting and other static analysis tools
    - Code layout and design
- Documentation:
    - What documentation to produce
    - Picking and using a tech stack
    - Rendering (documentation often renders differently in different locations)
- Ecosystem Integration:
    - How to fit in well with the tools around you
    - Versioning 
    - Publishing to PyPI
    - How and what to automate
    - How to do releases
- Community Considerations:
    - Code review standards
    - Clear presentation of information
    - Understanding your user base and audience">
