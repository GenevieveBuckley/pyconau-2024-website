                <section class="description">
                    <p>The non-for-profit AustSTEM foundation provides access and assistance to STEM learning<br>
across Australian schools with emphasis on year 5 through to year 7.  AustSTEM has developed<br>
the Kookaberry learning platform which includes a small microcontroller-based board with<br>
a screen, buttons, wireless connectivity, and facility to connect many different<br>
kinds of sensors.  A web-based coding and teaching environment integrates with the<br>
Kookaberry hardware and allows programming in both the visual Blockly language and Python,<br>
with very easy transition between the two.  Teachers also have the option to use a Raspberry<br>
Pi Pico with add-on hardware within this learning platform, making the platform more<br>
accessible and flexible.</p>
<p>Most programming in primary school is based on visual block-based languages like Scratch.<br>
The Kookaberry leverages Blockly to provide a way for students to program physical<br>
hardware (a microcontroller running MicroPython) and interact with the environment through<br>
sensors such as accelerometers, pressure and moisture sensors and light sensors, and interact using<br>
LEDs and motors.  They also learn about data logging and visualising results of experiments<br>
using plots.  This gives students a very hands-on approach to learning to program, which<br>
helps to cement the learning objectives in the curriculum in real-world applications.</p>
<p>Following on from learning to program in Blockly, the Kookaberry platform allows easy<br>
transition to program in Python: the Blocks actually convert directly to Python snippets<br>
and so the students can gradually adapt their existing visual programming skills to<br>
textual coding in Python.</p>
<p>A big part of teaching students is first of all training teachers, and we will discuss<br>
some challenges in this area, and how Kookaberry gives the teachers are given a wide range<br>
of teaching tools so they can adapt the platform to their style.  We will show some lesson<br>
plans, which aim to attract and engage students of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the Kookaberry web-app is itself written in Python, and we will describe some<br>
technical details of how it all works.</p>
<p>There will be lots of pictures of kids in action!</p>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Damien was born in Melbourne, Australia, and has been programming and playing with<br>
electronic circuits since primary school. He completed a Bachelor of Engineering and<br>
Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, and then went on to complete a PhD in<br>
theoretical physics.</p>
<p>During his studies he participated in the international Robocup competition, programming<br>
autonomous robots to play soccer. He wrote embedded software for scripted behavioural<br>
control and motion, as well as building parts of the hardware. He has since continued in this<br>
area, building robots, a CNC machine, and writing embedded software for many<br>
microcontrollers.</p>
<p>He worked professionally as a theoretical physicist for 6 years, on various topics including<br>
cosmology and the Higgs boson. He then went on to develop MicroPython and ran two very<br>
successful Kickstarter campaigns around this microcontroller language. He now works full-<br>
time maintaining the MicroPython code-base and ecosystem.</p></div>
