DESCRIPTION:"What's the last common ancestor of a bear and a weasel?"\n"Whi
 ch animals are more related to pigs than cows?"\n"Are birds reptiles?"\n"A
 m I a fish?"\n\nWith a recent interest in phylogeny – the science of evo
 lution\, diversification\, and speciation – these are the kinds of quest
 ions I've been asking myself. I wanted to find a tool that would let me ex
 amine the relationships between species and find the answers to these ques
 tions\, but\, as I looked around I couldn't find anything that did what I 
 wanted. So I made it myself.\n\nCome with me as I share my journey that le
 d me to talk to some of Australia's top scientists\, give up on talking to
  other top scientists\, and accidentally stumble my way into making an act
 ual contribution to science. Learn why I made this tool\, how I made this 
 tool\, what stage it's at\, and where you can use it yourself. And maybe l
 earn some things about life on Earth along the way.\n\nOh\, and to answer 
 the questions above: dog-bears\, peccaries\, yes\, and yes!
