                    <p>This talk is designed for teachers, students, or anyone new to AI to get a better understanding of what “AI” is, to see the broad range of technologies “AI” can includes, and to demystify all pieces of terminology like GPT, LLMs, and more!</p>
<p>I’ll demo a light-weight project that you can use to get students leveraging GPT technology through their own code creations. We’ll then add some of our own data to give it specialised knowledge in a technique known as “RAG” (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Through the process of testing out this project we’ll then explore the moments where students can see behind the curtain of what tools like ChatGPT are actually doing, where they fall down and aren’t as “smart” as they seem, and how and when to use AI responsibly. </p>
<p>This talk will specifically highlight an open-source option for playing with AI in Python so you can get your class coding on these tools for free.</p>
