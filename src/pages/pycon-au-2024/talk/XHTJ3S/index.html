        <meta name="description" content="In the past decade, this school has consistently exceeded VCE expectations in Software Development, largely due to well-developed resources, consistency in use of programming language (Visual Basic) and progression of skills through year 7 to year 12. However, a gap analysis in the teaching methodology has highlighted conceptual computational thinking and problem-solving skills as a key gap in the current offering. This was attributed to the curriculum&#x27;s skills-based focus and the Covid-era teaching practice of flipped learning via video tutorials.  

This has presented an opportunity to overhaul the teaching methodology to focus on equipping students with the skills to apply their learning in different contexts.  Some key aspects of this transformation include a more live coding technique and transitioning to Python as the preferred programming language, due to its versatility and future prospects for students.  

We present this roadmap which leads to a complete overhaul of our teaching programmes from year 7 to year 12, scaffolding Python across Applied Computing, STEM projects, Robotics and Game development over the next 6 months.">
