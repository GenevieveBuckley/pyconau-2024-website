DESCRIPTION:Verifying\, evaluating or interpreting complex data requires sp
 ecialist tools and methods. Many data scientists\, programmers and scienti
 sts will be familiar with some evaluation metrics such as accuracy\, mean 
 squared error or true positive rate. There are many situations where these
  scores are insufficient for assessing correctness\, accuracy or suitabili
 ty of a model or prediction. The challenge of verifying models and predict
 ions affects most fields of science\, engineering\, and many machine learn
 ing applications.\n\nThis talk will introduce "scores"\, an open source Py
 thon package for verifying and evaluating labelled\, n-dimensional (multid
 imensional) data at any scale. "scores" includes over 50 metrics\, statist
 ical techniques and data processing tools. The software repository can be 
 found at https://github.com/nci/scores and the documentation can be found 
 at https://scores.readthedocs.io/ .\n\nThis talk is suitable for beginner\
 , intermediate and expert audiences. Developers and data scientists who ar
 e familiar mainly with tabular data\, such as supported by the pandas libr
 ary\, may be interested in the additional functionality offered by "scores
 " (and the xarray library it utilises). For those learning about more adva
 nced methods\, every metric and statistical test has a companion Jupyter N
 otebook tutorial. For expert users already familiar with these ideas\, you
  may be interested in some of the novel scoring methods not commonly found
  in other packages. \n\nCome to this talk to hear about:\n - The differenc
 e between tabular data\, n-dimensional data\, and labelled n-dimensional d
 ata\n - Examples of using a common metric from "scores" on labelled\, n-di
 mensional data\n - Examples of using "scores" for interrogating data in mu
 ltiple dimensions\n - Examples of where basic methods overlook important c
 onsiderations\n - Examples of using some of the more complex metrics in "s
 cores"
