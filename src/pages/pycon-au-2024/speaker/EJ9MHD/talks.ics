DESCRIPTION:Being a fast-paced startup and developing a completely new prod
 uct in the Space Industry is very challenging\, and moving fast wasn’t j
 ust a requirement but essential. It's the kind of environment that is hard
  to think too much ahead\, and for that reason\, our database was created 
 to address the problems we had at hand. \nAfter a while\, new products and
  features were required\, and our database couldn't handle all of them. Th
 at’s when we decided to move our data to a newly designed database insta
 nce with proper relationships\, able to handle more features\, higher work
 loads and scalable. During the planning phase\, several approaches were di
 scussed\, such as creating a script to copy the data and some off-the-shel
 f software that we thought could handle that for us. However\, the complex
 ity of implementing those approaches wasn’t feasible with our deadlines 
 for releasing the new product. So\, we decided to copy the data using Djan
 go ORM (our product was already using Django)\, the idea was to avoid the 
 complexity of creating complex SQL Queries to copy data to new tables whil
 e keeping the data consistency and integrity.\nIn this presentation\, we a
 im to demonstrate how our database was limiting the company’s scalabilit
 y and how we fixed those problems by migrating to a new database schema wh
 ilst maintaining two database instances\, one for internal operations and 
 the other for customer-facing functions. Moreover\, we show how we did tha
 t using object-oriented programming in combination with Django’s ORM to 
 migrate our database without the need to handle complex SQL commands to co
 py data\, keep relationships\, and create new ones.
