I have been fascinated by how computing works since young, and decided to learn programming then! </p>
                                        <p>In my free time I enjoy creating 3D models, photography and videography, playing music and bouldering. I’m looking forward to putting my computing skills in my hobbies as well, such as integrating computer vision with photography and videography. In the meantime, I would love to learn more about different aspects in machine learning and theoretical computing. </p>
                                        <p>Hi, I am Anneysha, I am studying Advanced Computing at the Australian National University. I love languages, and learning as many language scripts as I can!</p>
                                        <p>I am interested in solving problems using a human-centric approach with strong backing from existing data and applying computational techniques to it, such as Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. In my free time, I like watching anime, cooking (things I’ve never made before!), and travelling.</p>
                                        <p>Fun fact: Eliz and I met in our first semester at university when we were doing the same Finance and Computing courses. 🙂</p></div>

She is harnessing Python's powerful data processing capabilities to automate a complex systematic review, synthesising vast amounts of medical literature to create a more holistic understanding of the far-reaching impacts of current maternity practices on women, children, health systems, and even the environment.</p>

This work has expanded our understanding of the drowning burden in the state, showcasing Python's versatility in public health research.</p>
                                        <p>Edwina's innovative approaches demonstrate how Python can accelerate and enhance research in public health, from streamlining data analysis to increasing the scope and depth of evidence synthesis.</p>

Their research focuses on the study of Bronze Age Aegean administrative documents; in particular, the application of digital methods such as 3D modelling, shape analysis and phylogenetics to better understand these artefacts. In addition to their PhD research, Emily is involved in an ongoing collaboration with the Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP), exploring the application of deep learning techniques to the decipherment of ancient scripts, including the presently undeciphered Linear A. Prior to retraining as an archaeologist, Emily worked in the IT industry as a software tester and business analyst, and is passionate about combining both her digital and archaeological skills for improved research outcomes, as well as supporting and promoting the uptake of digital techniques in the humanities. Emily is a current committee member for the Australasian chapter of Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA).</p></div>

I realised that "open source" didn't mean just posting the code online. It meant actively collaborating on code with other scientists, across vast distances and at different times. Before you could say "import numpy as np", I had joined the scikit-image team, written a paper about it, written a whole book on SciPy (!), spoken at various SciPys and PyConAUs, started new collaborative, open source libraries, and just generally been all-in on Scientific Python. I love this community and what it has done for me, and always try to pay it forward for new folks in our community! 😊</p></div>
