DESCRIPTION:In the past decade\, this school has consistently exceeded VCE 
 expectations in Software Development\, largely due to well-developed resou
 rces\, consistency in use of programming language (Visual Basic) and progr
 ession of skills through year 7 to year 12. However\, a gap analysis in th
 e teaching methodology has highlighted conceptual computational thinking a
 nd problem-solving skills as a key gap in the current offering. This was a
 ttributed to the curriculum's skills-based focus and the Covid-era teachin
 g practice of flipped learning via video tutorials.  \n\nThis has presente
 d an opportunity to overhaul the teaching methodology to focus on equippin
 g students with the skills to apply their learning in different contexts. 
  Some key aspects of this transformation include a more live coding techni
 que and transitioning to Python as the preferred programming language\, du
 e to its versatility and future prospects for students.  \n\nWe present th
 is roadmap which leads to a complete overhaul of our teaching programmes f
 rom year 7 to year 12\, scaffolding Python across Applied Computing\, STEM
  projects\, Robotics and Game development over the next 6 months.
