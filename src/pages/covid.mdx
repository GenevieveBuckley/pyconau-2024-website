# Covid-19 information

Covid-19 is in the community, which presents a risk to all of us, but
not all of us equally. There are people in our community who are at
higher risk of contracting Covid-19, or higher risk of severe negative
outcomes, and those people deserve a chance to participate.

PyCon AU will have a robust Covid-19 risk mitigation policy that goes
above and beyond what is legally required of us. We'll also need to
impose some requirements on our attendees, so that we can all protect
each other. We might not be able to do everything we'd like to, but we
will do everything we can reasonably do.

Part of these restrictions are likely to include a mask-wearing
requirement for indoor spaces.

As soon as we can (and before ticket sales begin), we'll update this
page with specific details about the commitments we are going to make
to our community, and the requirements we expect our community members
to follow.
